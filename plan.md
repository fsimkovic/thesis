### 6. New approaches to search model selection for unconventional MR

### 6.1 Decoy subselection using contact information to enhance MR search model creation
This sub-chapter will discuss the use of contact information to score ab initio decoys, how this information could be used to enhance ensemble search model quality and ultimately MR success.

### Appendix

#### S1. Software developments

#### S1.1 ConKit
This section will describe the ConKit package, and any algorithms implemented to assess contact and sequence information. 
It will expand on Simkovic et al (2017) and describe the package in more detail.

#### S1.2 Integration of ConKit in AMPLE
This section will briefly outline the integration of ConKit in AMPLE

#### S1.3 Truncation of single models in AMPLE
This section will outline the algorithm implemented into AMPLE to truncate single decoys
