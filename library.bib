abstract = {Ab initio phasing with de novo models has become a viable approach for structural solution from protein crystallographic diffraction data. This approach takes advantage of the known protein sequence information, predicts de novo models and uses them for structure determination by molecular replacement. However, even the current state-of-the-art de novo modelling method has a limit as to the accuracy of the model predicted, which is sometimes insufficient to be used as a template for successful molecular replacement. A fragment-assembly phasing method has been developed that starts from an ensemble of low-accuracy de novo models, disassembles them into fragments, places them independently in the crystallographic unit cell by molecular replacement and then reassembles them into a whole structure that can provide sufficient phase information to enable complete structure determination by automated model building. Tests on ten protein targets showed that the method could solve structures for eight of these targets, although the predicted de novo models cannot be used as templates for successful molecular replacement since the best model for each target is on average more than 4.0 {\AA} away from the native structure. The method has extended the applicability of the ab initio phasing by de novo models approach. The method can be used to solve structures when the best de novo models are still of low accuracy.},

abstract = {Background: The actin-binding site of several cytoskeletal proteins is comprised of two calponin homology (CH) domains in a tandem arrangement. As a single copy, the CH domain is also found in regulatory proteins in muscle and in signal-transduction proteins. The three-dimensional structures of three CH domains are known, but they have not yet clarified the molecular details of the interaction between actin filaments and proteins harbouring CH domains. Results: We have compared the crystal structure of a CH domain from $\beta$-spectrin, which has been refined to 1.1 {\AA} resolution, with the two CH domains that constitute the actin-binding region of fimbrin. This analysis has allowed the construction of a structure-based sequence alignment of CH domains that can be used in further comparisons of members of the CH domain family. The study has also improved our understanding of the factors that determine domain architecture, and has led to discussion on the functional differences that seem to exist between subfamilies of CH domains, as regards binding to F-actin. Conclusions: Our analysis supports biochemical data that implicate a surface centered at the last helix of the N-terminal CH domain as the most probable actin-binding site in cytoskeletal proteins. It is not clear whether the C-terminal domains of the tandem arrangement or the single CH domains have this function alone. This may imply that although the CH domains are homologous and have a conserved structure, they may have evolved to perform different functions.},

abstract = {De novo membrane protein structure prediction is limited to small proteins due to the confor- mational search space quickly expanding with length. Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid separation)–residue positions distant in sequence, but in close proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL::Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models folded was reduced by an average of 2 {\AA} for a benchmark of 25 membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Cell metabolism relies on energy transduction usually performed by complex membrane-spanning proteins that couple different chemical processes, e.g. electron and proton transfer in proton-pumps. There is great interest in determining at the molecular level the structural details that control these energy transduction events, particularly those involving multiple electrons and protons, because tight control is required to avoid the production of dangerous reactive intermediates. Tetraheme cytochrome c(3) is a small soluble and monomeric protein that performs a central step in the bioenergetic metabolism of sulfate reducing bacteria, termed "proton-thrusting," linking the oxidation of molecular hydrogen with the reduction of sulfate. The mechano-chemical coupling involved in the transfer of multiple electrons and protons in cytochrome c(3) from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 is described using results derived from the microscopic thermodynamic characterization of the redox and acid-base centers involved, crystallographic studies in the oxidized and reduced states of the cytochrome, and theoretical studies of the redox and acid-base transitions. This proton-assisted two-electron step involves very small, localized structural changes that are sufficient to generate the complex network of functional cooperativities leading to energy transduction, while using molecular mechanisms distinct from those established for other Desulfovibrio sp. cytochromes from the same structural family.},

Its function in cerebral water balance has implications in neuropathological disorders, including brain edema, stroke, and head injuries. The 1.8-A crystal structure reveals the molecular basis for the water selectivity of the channel. Unlike the case in the structures of water-selective AQPs AqpZ and AQP1, the asparagines of the 2 Asn-Pro-Ala motifs do not hydrogen bond to the same water molecule; instead, they bond to 2 different water molecules in the center of the channel. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to ask how this observation bears on the proposed mechanisms for how AQPs remain totally insulating to any proton conductance while maintaining a single file of hydrogen bonded water molecules throughout the channel.},

abstract = {In a previous paper [Lindley et al. (1993), Acta Cryst. D49, 292-304], the X-ray structure analysis of the 18 kDa fragment of duck ovotransferrin, corresponding to the NII domain of the intact protein, was reported at a resolution of 2.3 A. In this structure, the FeIII cation binds to two tyrosine residues and the synergistic carbonate anion in an identical manner to that found in the intact protein. However, the aspartate and histidine residues, normally involved in iron binding in transferrins, are absent in the fragment and it was not possible to unequivocally define what had replaced them. The electron density was tentatively assigned to be a mixture of peptides, presumably resulting from the proteolytic preparation of the fragment, binding to the iron through their amino and carboxylate termini. A more recent X-ray analysis of the fragment, from a different preparation, has resulted in a structure at 1.95 A, in which glycine appears to be the predominant residue bound to the cation. In an alternative attempt to clarify the binding of iron to the 18 kDa fragment, the metal was removed by dialysis and replaced in the form of ferric nitrilotriacetate. Crystallization of this complex has resulted in an X-ray structure at 1.90 A in which the FeIII is bound to the synergistic carbonate anion and only one tyrosine residue in a manner almost identical to the intact protein. The carboxylate groups and the tertiary amino group of the nitrilotriacetate occupy the remaining coordination sites. The second tyrosine residue, Tyr95, is not bound directly to the iron. The implication of these structures with respect to the mechanism of iron binding by the transferrins is addressed.},

The protein consists of a single compact L-shaped domain, composed of seven $\alpha$-helices including about 70{\%} of the total residues. Three-dimensional homology searches did not reveal structural homologues, and CagZ can be considered representative of a new protein fold.

abstract = {Computational prediction of membrane protein (MP) structures is very challenging partially due to lack of sufficient solved structures for homology modeling. Recently direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA) sheds some light on protein contact prediction and accordingly, contact-assisted folding, but DCA is effective only on some very large-sized families since it uses information only in a single protein family. This paper presents a deep transfer learning method that can significantly improve MP contact prediction by learning contact patterns and complex sequence-contact relationship from thousands of non-membrane proteins (non-MPs). Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs, our deep model (learned from only non-MPs) has top L/10 long-range contact prediction accuracy 0.69, better than our deep model trained by only MPs (0.63) and much better than a representative DCA method CCMpred (0.47) and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV (0.55). The accuracy of our deep model can be further improved to 0.72 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs. When only contacts in transmembrane regions are evaluated, our method has top L/10 long-range accuracy 0.62, 0.57, and 0.53 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, by non-MPs only, and by MPs only, respectively, still much better than MetaPSICOV (0.45) and CCMpred (0.40). All these results suggest that sequence-structure relationship learned by our deep model from non-MPs generalizes well to MP contact prediction. Improved contact prediction also leads to better contact-assisted folding. Using only top predicted contacts as restraints, our deep learning method can fold 160 and 200 of 510 MPs with TMscore{\textgreater}0.6 when trained by non-MPs only and by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, respectively, while CCMpred and MetaPSICOV can do so for only 56 and 77 MPs, respectively. Our contact-assisted folding also greatly outperforms homology modeling.},

abstract = {Here we present the results of protein contact prediction achieved in CASP12 by our RaptorX-Contact server, which is an early implementation of our deep learning method for contact prediction. On a set of 38 free-modeling target domains with a median family size of around 58 effective sequences, our server obtained an average top L/5 long- and medium-range contact accuracy of 47{\%} and 44{\%}, respectively (L=length). A more advanced implementation has an average accuracy of 59{\%} and 57{\%}, respectively. Our deep learning method formulates contact prediction as a pixel-level labeling problem and simultaneously predicts all residue pairs of a protein using a combination of two deep residual neural networks, taking as input the residue conservation information, predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility, contact potential, and co-evolution information. Our approach differs from existing methods mainly in (1) formulating contact prediction as a pixel-level image labeling problem instead of an image-level classification problem; (2) simultaneously predicting all contacts of an individual protein to make effective use of contact occurrence patterns; and (3) integrating both 1D and 2D deep convolutional neural networks to effectively learn complex sequence-structure relationship including high-order residue correlation. This paper discusses the RaptorX-Contact pipeline, both contact prediction and contact-based folding results, and finally the strength and weakness of our method.

abstract = {Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is an integral membrane protein in the mitochondrial anion carrier protein family, the members of which facilitate the transport of small molecules across the mitochondrial inner membrane. When the mitochondrial respiratory complex pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, it builds up an electrochemical potential. A fraction of this electrochemical potential is dissipated as heat, in a process involving leakage of protons back to the matrix. This leakage, or 'uncoupling' of the proton electrochemical potential, is mediated primarily by uncoupling proteins. However, the mechanism of UCP-mediated proton translocation across the lipid bilayer is unknown. Here we describe a solution-NMR method for structural characterization of UCP2. The method, which overcomes some of the challenges associated with membrane-protein structure determination, combines orientation restraints derived from NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and semiquantitative distance restraints from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements. The local and secondary structures of the protein were determined by piecing together molecular fragments from the Protein Data Bank that best fit experimental RDCs from samples weakly aligned in a DNA nanotube liquid crystal. The RDCs also determine the relative orientation of the secondary structural segments, and the PRE restraints provide their spatial arrangement in the tertiary fold. UCP2 closely resembles the bovine ADP/ATP carrier (the only carrier protein of known structure), but the relative orientations of the helical segments are different, resulting in a wider opening on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Moreover, the nitroxide-labelled GDP binds inside the channel and seems to be closer to transmembrane helices 1-4. We believe that this biophysical approach can be applied to other membrane proteins and, in particular, to other mitochondrial carriers, not only for structure determination but also to characterize various conformational states of these proteins linked to substrate transport.},

Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range contacts-around 60{\%} higher than PSICOV, and around 40{\%} better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV.

abstract = {Motivation: A few years ago it was shown that by using a maximum entropy approach to describe couplings between columns in a multiple sequence alignment it is possible to significantly increase the accuracy of residue contact predictions. For very large protein families with more than 1000 effective sequences the accuracy is sufficient to produce accurate models of proteins as well as complexes. Today, for about half of all Pfam domain families no structure is known, but unfortunately most of these families have at most a few hundred members, i.e. are too small for such contact prediction methods. Results: To extend accurate contact predictions to the thousands of smaller protein families we present PconsC3, a fast and improved method for protein contact predictions that can be used for families with even 100 effective sequence members. PconsC3 outperforms direct coupling analysis (DCA) methods significantly independent on family size, secondary structure content, contact range, or the number of selected contacts. Availability: PconsC3 is available as a web server and downloadable version at http://c3.pcons.net. The downloadable version is free for all to use and licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2. At this site contact predictions for most Pfam families are also available. We do estimate that more than 4000 contact maps for Pfam families of unknown structure have more than 50{\%} of the top-ranked contacts predicted correctly.},

abstract = {Sequence-based prediction of residue-residue contact in proteins becomes increasingly more important for improving protein structure prediction in the big data era. In this study, we performed a large-scale comparative assessment of 15 locally installed contact predictors. To assess these methods, we collected a big data set consisting of 680 nonredundant proteins covering different structural classes and target difficulties. We investigated a wide range of factors that may influence the precision of contact prediction, including target difficulty, structural class, the alignment depth and distribution of contact pairs in a protein structure. We found that: (1) the machine learning-based methods outperform the direct-coupling-based methods for short-range contact prediction, while the latter are significantly better for long-range contact prediction. The consensus-based methods, which combine machine learning and direct-coupling methods, perform the best. (2) The target difficulty does not have clear influence on the machine learning-based methods, while it does affect the direct-coupling and consensus-based methods significantly. (3) The alignment depth has relatively weak effect on the machine learning-based methods. However, for the direct-coupling-based methods and consensus-based methods, the predicted contacts for targets with deeper alignment tend to be more accurate. (4) All methods perform relatively better on $\beta$ and $\alpha$ + $\beta$ proteins than on $\alpha$ proteins. (5) Residues buried in the core of protein structure are more prone to be in contact than residues on the surface (22 versus 6{\%}). We believe these are useful results for guiding future development of new approach to contact prediction.},

abstract = {Predicted protein residue-residue contacts can be used to build three-dimensional models and consequently to predict protein folds from scratch. A considerable amount of effort is currently being spent to improve contact prediction accuracy, whereas few methods are available to construct protein tertiary structures from predicted contacts. Here, we present an ab initio protein folding method to build three-dimensional models using predicted contacts and secondary structures. Our method first translates contacts and secondary structures into distance, dihedral angle, and hydrogen bond restraints according to a set of new conversion rules, and then provides these restraints as input for a distance geometry algorithm to build tertiary structure models. The initially reconstructed models are used to regenerate a set of physically realistic contact restraints and detect secondary structure patterns, which are then used to reconstruct final structural models. This unique two-stage modeling approach of integrating contacts and secondary structures improves the quality and accuracy of structural models and in particular generates better -sheets than other algorithms. We validate our method on two standard benchmark datasets using true contacts and secondary structures. Our method improves TM-score of reconstructed protein models by 45{\%} and 42{\%} over the existing method on the two datasets, respectively. On the dataset for benchmarking reconstructions methods with predicted contacts and secondary structures, the average TM-score of best models reconstructed by our method is 0.59, 5.5{\%} higher than the existing method.

ARCIMBOLDO solves the phase problem at resolutions of around 2 {\AA} or better through massive combination of small fragments and density modification. For complex structures, this imposes a need for a powerful grid where calculations can be distributed, but for structures with up to 200 amino acids in the asymmetric unit a single workstation may suffice. The use and performance of the single-workstation implementation, ARCIMBOLDO-LITE, on a pool of test structures with 40-120 amino acids and resolutions between 0.54 and 2.2 {\AA} is described. Inbuilt polyalanine helices and iron cofactors are used as search fragments. ARCIMBOLDO-BORGES can also run on a single workstation to solve structures in this test set using precomputed libraries of local folds. The results of this study have been incorporated into an automated, resolution- and hardware-dependent parameterization.

abstract = {We have developed a new scoring function, the template modeling score (TM-score), to assess the quality of protein structure templates and predicted full-length models by extending the approaches used in Global Distance Test (GDT)1 and MaxSub.2 First, a protein size-dependent scale is exploited to eliminate the inherent protein size dependence of the previous scores and appropriately account for random protein structure pairs. Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR{\_}3 and built the full-length models using MODELLER and TASSER. The TM-score of the initial threading alignments, compared to the GDT and MaxSub scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length models. The TM-score is further exploited as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a useful complement to the fully automated assessment of protein structure predictions.

Spectral assignment of individual chlorophylls indicates the flow of energy in the complex and the mechanism of photoprotection in two close chlorophyll a-lutein pairs.

Here, we present PconsC2, a novel method that uses a deep learning approach to identify protein-like contact patterns to improve contact predictions. A substantial enhancement can be seen for all contacts independently on the number of aligned sequences, residue separation or secondary structure type, but is largest for $\beta$-sheet containing proteins. In addition to being superior to earlier methods based on statistical inferences, in comparison to state of the art methods using machine learning, PconsC2 is superior for families with more than 100 effective sequence homologs.

abstract = {Titin-like kinases are muscle-specific kinases that regulate mechanical sensing in the sarcomere. Twitchin kinase (TwcK) is the best-characterized member of this family, both structurally and enzymatically. TwcK activity is auto-inhibited by a dual intrasteric mechanism, in which N- and C-terminal tail extensions wrap around the kinase domain, blocking the hinge region, the ATP binding pocket and the peptide substrate binding groove. Physiologically, kinase activation is thought to occur by a stretch-induced displacement of the inhibitory tails from the kinase domain. Here, we now show that TwcK inhibits its catalysis even in the absence of regulatory tails, by undergoing auto-phosphorylation at mechanistically important elements of the kinase fold. Using mass spectrometry, site-directed mutagenesis and catalytic assays on recombinant samples we identify residues T212, T301, T316 and T401 as primary auto-phosphorylation sites in TwcK in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that residue T316, located in the peptide substrate binding P+1 loop, is the dominantly regulatory site in TwcK. Based on these findings, we conclude that TwcK is regulated through a triple inhibitory mechanism consisting of phosphorylation as well as intrasteric blockage, which is responsive not only to mechanical cues but also to biochemical modulation. This implies that mechanically stretched conformations of TwcK do not necessarily correspond to catalytically active states, as previously postulated. This further suggests a phosphorylation-dependent desensitization of the TwcK-mediated mechanoresponse of the sarcomere in vivo.},

abstract = {Recently developed methods have shown considerable promise in predicting residue-residue contacts in protein 3D structures using evolutionary covariance information. However, these methods require large numbers of evolutionarily related sequences to robustly assess the extent of residue covariation, and the larger the protein family, the more likely that contact information is unnecessary because a reasonable model can be built based on the structure of a homolog. Here we describe a method that integrates sequence coevolution and structural context information using a pseudolikelihood approach, allowing more accurate contact predictions from fewer homologous sequences. We rigorously assess the utility of predicted contacts for protein structure prediction using large and representative sequence and structure databases from recent structure prediction experiments. We find that contact predictions are likely to be accurate when the number of aligned sequences (with sequence redundancy reduced to 90{\%}) is greater than five times the length of the protein, and that accurate predictions are likely to be useful for structure modeling if the aligned sequences are more similar to the protein of interest than to the closest homolog of known structure. These conditions are currently met by 422 of the protein families collected in the Pfam database.},

Reliable models at resolutions at least as low as 4 {\AA} can be achieved thanks to low-resolution refinement tools such as secondary-structure restraints, restraints to known homologous structures, automatic global and local NCS restraints, `jelly-body' restraints and the use of novel long-range restraints on atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

PSI-BLAST analysis against a non-redundant sequence database gave 68 similar sequences referred to as 'conserved hypothetical proteins' from the uncharacterized protein family UPF0054 (accession No. PF02310). Crystallographic analysis revealed that the overall fold of this protein consists of one central alpha-helix surrounded by a four-stranded beta-sheet and four other alpha-helices. Structure-based homology analysis with DALI revealed that the structure has a moderate to good resemblance to metal-dependent proteinases such as collagenases and gelatinases, thus suggesting its possible molecular function. However, experimental tests for collagenase and gelatinase-type function show no detectable activity under standard assay conditions. Therefore, we suggest either that the members of the UPF0054 family have a similar fold but different biochemical functions to those of collagenases and gelatinases or that they have a similar function but perform it under different conditions.},

They show exceptionally high thermodynamic stabilities, even when compared to members of consensus DARPin libraries and even more so when compared to naturally occurring ankyrin repeat proteins. We determined the crystal structure of a full-consensus DARPin, containing an N-capping repeat, three identical internal repeats and a C-capping repeat at 2.05 {\AA} resolution, and compared its structure with that of the related DARPin library members E3{\_}5 and E3{\_}19. This structural comparison suggests that primarily salt bridges on the surface, which arrange in a network with almost crystal-like regularity, increase thermostability in the full-consensus NI3C DARPin to make it resistant to boiling. In the crystal structure, three sulfate ions complement this network. Thermal denaturation experiments in guanidine hydrochloride directly indicate a contribution of sulfate binding to the stability, providing further evidence for the stabilizing effect of surface-exposed electrostatic interactions and regular charge networks. The charged residues at the place of randomized residues in the DARPin libraries were selected based on sequence statistics and suggested that the charge interaction network is a hidden design feature of this protein family. Ankyrins can therefore use design principles from proteins of thermophilic organisms and reach at least similar stabilities. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Protein ab initio models predicted from sequence data alone can enable the elucidation of crystal structures by molecular replacement. However, the calculation of such ab initio models is typically computationally expensive. Here, a computational pipeline based on the clustering and truncation of cheaply obtained ab initio models for the preparation of structure ensembles is described. Clustering is used to select models and to quantitatively predict their local accuracy, allowing rational truncation of predicted inaccurate regions. The resulting ensembles, with or without rapidly added side chains, solved 43{\%} of all test cases, with an 80{\%} success rate for all-[alpha] proteins. A program implementing this approach, AMPLE, is included in the CCP4 suite of programs. It only requires the input of a FASTA sequence file and a diffraction data file. It carries out the modelling using locally installed Rosetta, creates search ensembles and automatically performs molecular replacement and model rebuilding.},

abstract = {The structure of the copper protein plastocyanin from poplar leaves (Populus nigra var. italica) at 173 K has been subjected to two independent refinements, using a single set of synchrotron X-ray data at 1.6 A resolution. Energy-restrained refinement using the program EREF resulted in lower root-mean-square deviations from ideal geometry (e.g. 0.011 A for bond lengths) but a higher residual R (0.153) than restrained least-squares refinement using the program PROLSQ (0.014 A, 0.132). Electron-density difference maps in both refinements provided evidence for disorder at some side chains and solvent atoms, and the PROLSQ refinement made allowance for this disorder. The number of solvent sites identified at the 4[sigma]([rho]) level was 171 in the EREF refinement and 189 in the PROLSQ refinement; 159 of the solvent sites are common to both refinements within 1 A. The root-mean-square differences between the atomic positions produced by the two refinements are 0.08 A for C[alpha] atoms, 0.08 A for backbone atoms and 0.12 A for all non-H atoms (excluding six obvious outliers) of the protein molecule. The two sets of Cu-ligand bond lengths differ by up to 0.07 A, and the ligand-Cu-ligand angles by up to 7degrees. At 173 K the volume of the unit cell is 4.2{\%} smaller than at 295 K. Greater order in the solvent region is indicated by the location of 79 more solvent sites, the identification of extensive networks of hydrogen-bonded rings of solvent molecules, and a general decrease in the thermal parameters. Within the unit cell, the protein molecules are significantly translated and rotated from their positions at ambient temperature. An important structural change at low temperature is a 180degrees flip of the peptide group at Ser48-Gly49. Nearly all other significant differences between the structures of the protein at 173 and 295 K occur at exposed side chains. If the backbone atoms in the 173 and 295 K structures are superposed, excluding atoms involved in the peptide flip, the root-mean- square difference between the positions of 393 atoms is 0.25 A. Two internal water molecules, not included in previous descriptions of poplar plastocyanin, have been located. The plastocyanin Cu-site geometry at 173 K is not significantly different from that at 295 K. If plastocyanin undergoes a change in Cu-site geometry at low temperature, as has been suggested on the basis of resonance Raman spectroscopic evidence, then the change is not detected within the limits of precision of the present results.},

abstract = {Motivation The recently developed direct coupling analysis (DCA) method has greatly improved the accuracy with which residue-residue contacts can be predicted from multiple sequence alignments. Contact prediction accuracy, though, is still often not sufficient for complete ab initio protein structure prediction. DCA can, however, support protein structure studies in several ways. Results We show that DCA can select the better structure from among properly folded and misfolded variants. This idea was tested by comparing obsolete PDB files with their more correctly folded successors and by the comparison of structures with deliberately misfolded decoy models from the Decoys 'R' Us database. The DCA method systematically predicts more contacts for properly folded structures than for misfolded ones. The method works much better for X-ray structures than for NMR structures.

abstract = {Residue-residue contacts are key features for accurate de novo protein structure prediction. For the optimal utilization of these predicted contacts in folding proteins accurately, it is important to study the challenges of reconstructing protein structures using true contacts. Because contact-guided protein modeling approach is valuable for predicting the folds of proteins that do not have structural templates, it is necessary for reconstruction studies to focus on hard-to-predict protein structures. Using a data set consisting of 496 structural domains released in recent CASP experiments and a dataset of 150 representative protein structures, in this work, we discuss three techniques to improve the reconstruction accuracy using true contacts – adding secondary structures, increasing contact distance thresholds, and adding non-contacts. We find that reconstruction using secondary structures and contacts can deliver accuracy higher than using full contact maps. Similarly, we demonstrate that non-contacts can improve reconstruction accuracy not only when the used non-contacts are true but also when they are predicted. On the dataset consisting of 150 proteins, we find that by simply using low ranked predicted contacts as non-contacts and adding them as additional restraints, can increase the reconstruction accuracy by 5{\%} when the reconstructed models are evaluated using TM-score. Our findings suggest that secondary structures are invaluable companions of contacts for accurate reconstruction. Confirming some earlier findings, we also find that larger distance thresholds are useful for folding many protein structures which cannot be folded using the standard definition of contacts. Our findings also suggest that for more accurate reconstruction using predicted contacts it is useful to predict contacts at higher distance thresholds (beyond 8 {\AA}) and predict non-contacts.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The accurate prediction of residue-residue contacts, critical for maintaining the native fold of a protein, remains an open problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. Interest in this long-standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic improvements and the rapid growth in the sizes of sequence families. Progress could have major impacts in both structure and function prediction to name but two benefits. Sequence-based contact predictions are usually made by identifying correlated mutations within multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), most commonly through the information-theoretic approach of calculating mutual information between pairs of sites in proteins. These predictions are often inaccurate because the true covariation signal in the MSA is often masked by biases from many ancillary indirect-coupling or phylogenetic effects. Here we present a novel method, PSICOV, which introduces the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein contact prediction. Our method builds on work which had previously demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly coupled mutation correlations in the MSA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PSICOV displays a mean precision substantially better than the best performing normalized mutual information approach and Bayesian networks. For 118 out of 150 targets, the L/5 (i.e. top-L/5 predictions for a protein of length L) precision for long-range contacts (sequence separation {\textgreater}23) was ≥ 0.5, which represents an improvement sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein structure prediction or model quality assessment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The PSICOV source code can be downloaded from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/PSICOV.},

A theoretical understanding of the signal-to-noise ratio in likelihood-based molecular replacement searches has been developed to account for the influence of model quality and completeness, as well as the resolution of the diffraction data. Here we show that, contrary to current belief, molecular replacement need not be restricted to the use of models comprising a substantial fraction of the unknown structure. Instead, likelihood-based methods allow a continuum of applications depending predictably on the quality of the model and the resolution of the data. Unexpectedly, our understanding of the signal-to-noise ratio in molecular replacement leads to the finding that, with data to sufficiently high resolution, fragments as small as single atoms of elements usually found in proteins can yield ab initio solutions of macromolecular structures, including some that elude traditional direct methods.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The 3D structure of a protein sequence can be assembled from the substructures corresponding to small segments of this sequence. For each small sequence segment, there are only a few more likely substructures. We call them the 'structural alphabet' for this segment. Classical approaches such as ROSETTA used sequence profile and secondary structure information, to predict structural fragments. In contrast, we utilize more structural information, such as solvent accessibility and contact capacity, for finding structural fragments. RESULTS: Integer linear programming technique is applied to derive the best combination of these sequence and structural information items. This approach generates significantly more accurate and succinct structural alphabets with more than 50{\%} improvement over the previous accuracies. With these novel structural alphabets, we are able to construct more accurate protein structures than the state-of-art ab initio protein structure prediction programs such as ROSETTA. We are also able to reduce the Kolodny's library size by a factor of 8, at the same accuracy. AVAILABILITY: The online FRazor server is under construction.},

The Rosetta protein structure modeling suite can aid in the solution of difficult molecular-replacement problems using templates from 15 to 25{\%} sequence identity; Rosetta refinement guided by noisy density has consistently led to solved structures where other methods fail. In this paper, an overview of the use of Rosetta for these difficult molecular-replacement problems is provided and new modeling developments that further improve model quality are described. Several variations to the method are introduced that significantly reduce the time needed to generate a model and the sampling required to improve the starting template. The improvements are benchmarked on a set of nine difficult cases and it is shown that this improved method obtains consistently better models in less running time. Finally, strategies for best using Rosetta to solve difficult molecular-replacement problems are presented and future directions for the role of structure-prediction methods in crystallography are discussed.},

The molecular detail of protein-DNA interactions can be best visualized through crystallography, and structures emphasizing insight into the principles of binding and base-sequence recognition are essential to understanding the subtleties of the underlying mechanisms. An increasing number of high-quality DNA-binding protein structure determinations have been witnessed despite the fact that the crystallographic particularities of nucleic acids tend to pose specific challenges to methods primarily developed for proteins. Crystallographic structure solution of protein-DNA complexes therefore remains a challenging area that is in need of optimized experimental and computational methods. The potential of the structure-solution program ARCIMBOLDO for the solution of protein-DNA complexes has therefore been assessed. The method is based on the combination of locating small, very accurate fragments using the program Phaser and density modification with the program SHELXE. Whereas for typical proteins main-chain $\alpha$-helices provide the ideal, almost ubiquitous, small fragments to start searches, in the case of DNA complexes the binding motifs and DNA double helix constitute suitable search fragments. The aim of this work is to provide an effective library of search fragments as well as to determine the optimal ARCIMBOLDO strategy for the solution of this class of structures.},

abstract = {In humans, heme iron is the most abundant iron source, and bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus acquire it for growth. IsdB of S. aureus acquires Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX (heme) from hemoglobin for transfer to IsdC via IsdA. These three cell-wall-anchored Isd (iron-regulated surface determinant) proteins contain conserved NEAT (near iron transport) domains. The purpose of this work was to delineate the mechanism of heme binding and transfer between the NEAT domains of IsdA, IsdB, and IsdC using a combination of structural and spectroscopic studies. X-ray crystal structures of IsdA NEAT domain (IsdA-N1) variants reveal that removing the native heme-iron ligand Tyr166 is compensated for by iron coordination by His83 on the distal side and that no single mutation of distal loop residues is sufficient to perturb the IsdA-heme complex. Also, alternate heme-iron coordination was observed in structures of IsdA-N1 bound to reduced Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX and Co(III)-protoporphyrin IX. The IsdA-N1 structural data were correlated with heme transfer kinetics from the NEAT domains of IsdB and IsdC. We demonstrated that the NEAT domains transfer heme at rates comparable to full-length proteins. The second-order rate constant for heme transfer from IsdA-N1 was modestly affected ({\textless} 2-fold) by the IsdA variants, excluding those at Tyr166. Substituting Tyr166 with Ala or Phe changed the reaction mechanism to one with two observable steps and decreased observed rates {\textgreater} 15-fold (to 100-fold excess IsdC). We propose a heme transfer model wherein NEAT domain complexes pass heme iron directly from an iron-coordinating Tyr of the donor protein to the homologous Tyr residues of the acceptor protein. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

(iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes.

abstract = {Many naturally occurring protein systems function primarily as symmetric assemblies. Prediction of the quaternary structure of these assemblies is an important biological problem. This article describes automated tools we have developed for predicting the structures of symmetric protein assemblies in the Robetta structure prediction server. We assess the performance of this pipeline on a set of targets from the recent CASP12/CAPRI blind quaternary structure prediction experi-ment. Our approach successfully predicted 5 of 7 symmetric assemblies in this challenge, and was assessed as the best participating server group, and 1 of only 2 groups (human or server) with 2 predictions judged as high quality by the assessors. We also assess the method on a broader set of 22 natively symmetric CASP12 targets, where we show that oligomeric modeling can improve the accuracy of monomeric structure determination, particularly in highly intertwined oligomers. Oligomeric protein assemblies are important and ubiquitous in nature. Many proteins function as higher order symmetric assemblies, and understanding the nature of these higher order assemblies is key in understanding their function; disruption of these symmetric assemblies may be useful in developing drugs to inhibit function. These proteins only adopt a functional conformation when in their native oligomeric state, and therefore structure prediction methods that do not consider oligomeric state will be unable to determine the functional state. Despite this importance, however, there has been limited effort in per-forming structure prediction and oligomeric state assignment simulta-neously; many efforts subdivide the problem into 2 tasks 1 : structure prediction, 2–5 which considers determination of the constituent mono-mers, and protein docking, 6–9 which considers predicting the structure of assemblies from largely rigid monomers. In this article, we describe the fully automated multimeric structure prediction pipeline we have developed as part of the Robetta server. 10 When predicting the oligomeric assembly of a protein, our methods combine information on the oligomeric state of evolutionarily related proteins with Rosetta's physically realistic force field to assess the energetics of oligomer formation. The force field, fully described elsewhere, 11,12 combines several energy terms assessing particular physical interactions, and parameters are fit to a combination of experi-mental thermodynamic data and structure prediction goodness. We assess the performance of these methods on 22 natively symmetric targets from the recent CASP12 experiment, as compared with other structure prediction methods. We also compare to protein docking methods on a subset of 7 targets chosen as part of a CASP/CAPRI combined challenge. We use this experiment to test whether or not a method combining oligomeric state prediction and structure prediction could perform better than either method alone. That is, we wanted to assess whether explicit consideration of the oligomeric state would lead to improved prediction of monomeric structure compared with other structure prediction approaches, and whether it would lead to improved prediction of interface structure compared with other pro-tein/protein docking methods. 2 | M A TE RI A L S A ND M E THOD S Our symmetry detection, modeling, and determination pipeline broadly consists of 3 stages. The approach is based on the homology modeling of RosettaCM, 13 with 2 additional steps aimed at determining the cor-rect symmetry of the target complex. An overview of our approach is Proteins. 2017;1–9. indicated in Figure 1. In RosettaCM—as well as in this pipeline—model-ing begins by using 3 sequence alignment methods (Raptor, 4 Sparks, 5 and HHpred 14) to identify related template structures over a wide range of sequence identities. From these templates (up to 10 from each of the 3 methods), 2 quantities are computed that control the behavior of the protocol: target{\_}difficulty and P correct . The first, target{\_} difficulty, estimates the global distance test, total score (GDT-TS) of the template-based model for the given target by comparing the average pairwise TM-score of the top-ranking templates identified by 3 meth-ods. " Difficult targets " in Rosetta have target{\_}difficulty {\textless} 0.5. The latter measure, P correct , is a value that gets computed for each identified tem-plate, and measures the probability a particular ranked model is correct, given the target difficulty. We have added to this pipeline an additional step where we detect the native symmetry of templates, using author-assigned biological assembly records to determine template oligomerization. Templates that are symmetric are checked to ensure that residues making the symmetric interface exist in the current alignment, that is, that a resi-due deletion has not removed the entire interface. For targets that our pipeline predicts as difficult (target{\_}difficulty {\textless} 0.5), 13 or that our pipe-line predicts should be modeled as multi-domain targets, 10,15 the sym-metry detection and modeling step is omitted. Only the top 3 templates from each sequence alignment method are considered in symmetry generation, and the sum of P correct values from a particular point symmetry group must exceed 0.15 for that particular point group to get modeled. In the second stage of the approach, we perform structure model-ing and refinement in the context of the symmetric assembly. All sym-metric configurations from the first stage are considered separately, and homology modeling is carried out with RosettaCM. All stages of RosettaCM, including template combination, rebuilding of insertions and deletions, and all-atom refinement, take into account the ener-getics of the entire symmetric assembly. Each detected symmetry group is considered separately, and RosettaCM is always carried out asymmetrically in parallel (left path in Figure 1). All detected symmetry groups are then considered in the final step, where we use the results of the RosettaCM calculations with different symmetry configurations, and make a final decision on the overall symmetry of the system based FIG URE 1 A graphical overview of the symmetry determination and refinement pipeline. Starting with sequence alignments from Raptor, SPARKS, and HHsearch, we identify templates that are natively symmetric, ensure that aligned residues form the symmetric interfaces, and then model symmetrically in RosettaCM. Simultaneously, models are built and refined asymmetrically; model selection considers the predicted DG of oligomerization when choosing symmetric versus asymmetric predicted models [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 2 |},

Protein structure is strongly related to pro-tein function, but is difficult to elucidate experimentally, therefore computational structure prediction is a crucial task on the way to solve many biological questions. A contact map is a compact representation of the three-dimensional structure of a protein via the pairwise contacts between the amino acids constituting the protein. We use a convolutional network to calculate protein contact maps from detailed evolutionary coupling statistics between positions in the protein sequence. The input to the network has an image-like structure amenable to convolutions, but ev-ery " pixel " instead of color channels contains a bipartite undirected edge-weighted graph. We propose several methods for treating such " graph-valued images " in a convolutional network. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

They use (i) large sets of multiple aligned sequences and (ii) assume that correlations between columns in these alignments can be the results of indirect interaction. These methods are clearly superior to earlier methods when it comes to predicting contacts in proteins. Here, we demonstrate that combining predictions from two prediction methods, PSICOV and plmDCA, and two alignment methods, HHblits and jackhmmer at four different e-value cut-offs, provides a relative improvement of 20{\%} in comparison with the best single method, exceeding 70{\%} correct predictions for one contact prediction per residue.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

abstract = {Energy coupling factor (ECF) proteins are ATP-binding cassette transporters involved in the import of micronutrients in prokaryotes. They consist of two nucleotide-binding subunits and the integral membrane subunit EcfT, which together form the ECF module and a second integral membrane subunit that captures the substrate (the S component). Different S components, unrelated in sequence and specific for different ligands, can interact with the same ECF module. Here, we present a high-resolution crystal structure at 2.1 Å of the biotin-specific S component BioY from Lactococcus lactis. BioY shares only 16{\%} sequence identity with the thiamin-specific S component ThiT from the same organism, of which we recently solved a crystal structure. Consistent with the lack of sequence similarity, BioY and ThiT display large structural differences (rmsd = 5.1 Å), but the divergence is not equally distributed over the molecules: The S components contain a structurally conserved N-terminal domain that is involved in the interaction with the ECF module and a highly divergent C-terminal domain that binds the substrate. The domain structure explains how the S components with large overall structural differences can interact with the same ECF module while at the same time specifically bind very different substrates with subnanomolar affinity. Solitary BioY (in the absence of the ECF module) is monomeric in detergent solution and binds D-biotin with a high affinity but does not transport the substrate across the membrane.},

abstract = {For many protein families, the deluge of new sequence information together with new statistical protocols now allow the accurate prediction of contacting residues from sequence information alone. This offers the possibility of more accurate ab initio (non-homology-based) structure prediction. Such models can be used in structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) where the target fold is novel or is only distantly related to known structures. Here, AMPLE , an MR pipeline that assembles search-model ensembles from ab initio structure predictions (`decoys'), is employed to assess the value of contact-assisted ab initio models to the crystallographer. It is demonstrated that evolutionary covariance-derived residue–residue contact predictions improve the quality of ab initio models and, consequently, the success rate of MR using search models derived from them. For targets containing $\beta$-structure, decoy quality and MR performance were further improved by the use of a $\beta$-strand contact-filtering protocol. Such contact-guided decoys achieved 14 structure solutions from 21 attempted protein targets, compared with nine for simple Rosetta decoys. Previously encountered limitations were superseded in two key respects. Firstly, much larger targets of up to 221 residues in length were solved, which is far larger than the previously benchmarked threshold of 120 residues. Secondly, contact-guided decoys significantly improved success with $\beta$-sheet-rich proteins. Overall, the improved performance of contact-guided decoys suggests that MR is now applicable to a significantly wider range of protein targets than were previously tractable, and points to a direct benefit to structural biology from the recent remarkable advances in sequencing.},

In particular, the exclusion of homologs to the target from the libraries to correctly simulate a de novo protein structure prediction scenario, something which surprisingly is not always done. We demonstrate that fragments presenting different predominant predicted secondary structures should be treated differently during the fragment library generation step and that exhaustive and random search strategies should both be used.

On a validation set of 41 structurally diverse proteins, Flib libraries presents both a higher precision and coverage than two of the state-of-the-art methods, NNMake and HHFrag. Flib also achieves better precision and coverage on the set of 275 protein domains used in the two previous experiments of the the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP9 and CASP10).

abstract = {Signaling activity of bacterial chemotaxis transmembrane receptors is modulated by reversible covalent modification of specific receptor glutamate residues. The level of receptor methylation results from the activities of a specificS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, CheR, and the CheB methylesterase, which catalyzes hydrolysis of receptor glutamine or methylglutamate side-chains to glutamic acid. The CheB methylesterase belongs to a large family of response regulator proteins in which N-terminal regulatory domains control the activities of C-terminal effector domains. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of theSalmonella typhimuriumCherB methylesterase has been determined at 1.75 A{\AA} resolution. The domain has a modified, doubly wound $\alpha$/$\beta$ fold in which one of the helices is replaced by an anti-parallel $\beta$-hairpin. Previous biochemical and mutagenesis data suggest that the methylester hydrolysis catalyzed by CheB proceeds through a mechanism involving a serine nucleophile. The methylesterase active site is tentatively identified as a cleft at the C-terminal edge of the $\beta$-sheet containing residues Ser164, His190 and Asp286. The three-dimensional fold, and the arrangement of residues within the catalytic triad distinguishes the CheB methylesterase from any previously described serine protease or serine hydrolase. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press Limited.},

This enzymatic complex is activated by association of its cytosolic factors p67(phox), p47(phox), and the small G protein Rac with a membrane-associated flavocytochrome b(558). Here we report the crystal structure of the active N-terminal fragment of p67(phox) at 1.8 A resolution, as well as functional studies of p67(phox) mutants. This N-terminal region (residues 1-213) consists mainly of four TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) motifs in which the C terminus folds back into a hydrophobic groove formed by the TPR domain. The structure is very similar to that of the inactive truncated form of p67(phox) bound to the small G protein Rac previously reported, but differs by the presence of a short C-terminal helix (residues 187-193) that might be part of the activation domain. All p67(phox) mutants responsible for Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a severe defect of NADPH oxidase function, are localized in the N-terminal region. We investigated two CGD mutations, G78E and A128V. Surprisingly, the A128V CGD mutant is able to fully activate the NADPH oxidase in vitro at 25 degrees C. However, this point mutation represents a temperature-sensitive defect in p67(phox) that explains its phenotype at physiological temperature.},

abstract = {Residue pairs that directly coevolve in protein families are generally close in protein 3D structures. Here we study the exceptions to this general trend-directly coevolving residue pairs that are distant in protein structures-to determine the origins of evolutionary pressure on spatially distant residues and to understand the sources of error in contact-based structure prediction. Over a set of 4,000 protein families, we find that 25{\%} of directly coevolving residue pairs are separated by more than 5 {\AA} in protein structures and 3{\%} by more than 15 {\AA}. The majority (91{\%}) of directly coevolving residue pairs in the 5-15 {\AA} range are found to be in contact in at least one homologous structure-these exceptions arise from structural variation in the family in the region containing the residues. Thirty-five percent of the exceptions greater than 15 {\AA} are at homo-oligomeric interfaces, 19{\%} arise from family structural variation, and 27{\%} are in repeat proteins likely reflecting alignment errors. Of the remaining long-range exceptions ({\textless}1{\%} of the total number of coupled pairs), many can be attributed to close interactions in an oligomeric state. Overall, the results suggest that directly coevolving residue pairs not in repeat proteins are spatially proximal in at least one biologically relevant protein conformation within the family; we find little evidence for direct coupling between residues at spatially separated allosteric and functional sites or for increased direct coupling between residue pairs on putative allosteric pathways connecting them.},

abstract = {The structural basis of allosteric signaling in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is important in guiding design of therapeutics and understanding phenotypic consequences of genetic variation. The Evolutionary Trace (ET) algorithm previously proved effective in redesigning receptors to mimic the ligand specificities of functionally distinct homologs. We now expand ET to consider mutual information, with validation in GPCR structure and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) function. The new algorithm, called ET-MIp, identifies evolutionarily relevant patterns of amino acid covariations. The improved predictions of structural proximity and D2R mutagenesis demonstrate that ET-MIp predicts functional interactions between residue pairs, particularly potency and efficacy of activation by dopamine. Remarkably, although most of the residue pairs chosen for mutagenesis are neither in the binding pocket nor in contact with each other, many exhibited functional interactions, implying at-a-distance coupling. The functional interaction between the coupled pairs correlated best with the evolutionary coupling potential derived from dopamine receptor sequences rather than with broader sets of GPCR sequences. These data suggest that the allosteric communication responsible for dopamine responses is resolved by ET-MIp and best discerned within a short evolutionary distance. Most double mutants restored dopamine response to wild-type levels, also suggesting that tight regulation of the response to dopamine drove the coevolution and intramolecular communications between coupled residues. Our approach provides a general tool to identify evolutionary covariation patterns in small sets of close sequence homologs and to translate them into functional linkages between residues.},

abstract = {Despite the rapid progress of protein residue contact prediction, predicted residue contact maps frequently contain many errors. However, information of residue pairing in $\beta$ strands could be extracted from a noisy contact map, due to the presence of characteristic contact patterns in $\beta$-$\beta$ interactions. This information may benefit the tertiary structure prediction of mainly $\beta$ proteins. In this work, we introduce a novel ridge-detection-based $\beta$-$\beta$ contact predictor, RDb2C, to identify residue pairing in $\beta$ strands from any predicted residue contact map. The algorithm adopts ridge detection, a well-developed technique in computer image processing, to capture consecutive residue contacts, and then utilizes a novel multi-stage random forest framework to integrate the ridge information and additional features for prediction. Starting from the predicted contact map of CCMpred, RDb2C remarkably outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on two conventional test sets of $\beta$ proteins (BetaSheet916 and BetaSheet1452), and achieves F1-scores of {\~{}}62{\%} and {\~{}}76{\%} at the residue level and strand level, respectively. Taking the prediction of the more advanced RaptorX-Contact as input, RDb2C achieves impressively higher performance, with F1-scores reaching {\~{}}76{\%} and {\~{}}86{\%} at the residue level and strand level, respectively. According to our tests on 61 mainly $\beta$ proteins, improvement in the $\beta$-$\beta$ contact prediction can further ameliorate the structural prediction.

abstract = {Misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins are retro-translocated through the membrane into the cytosol, where they are poly-ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome-a pathway termed endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Proteins with misfolded domains in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen or membrane are discarded through the ERAD-L and ERAD-M pathways, respectively. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both pathways require the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, a multi-spanning membrane protein with a cytosolic RING finger domain. Hrd1 is the crucial membrane component for retro-translocation, but it is unclear whether it forms a protein-conducting channel. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of S. cerevisiae Hrd1 in complex with its endoplasmic reticulum luminal binding partner, Hrd3. Hrd1 forms a dimer within the membrane with one or two Hrd3 molecules associated at its luminal side. Each Hrd1 molecule has eight transmembrane segments, five of which form an aqueous cavity extending from the cytosol almost to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, while a segment of the neighbouring Hrd1 molecule forms a lateral seal. The aqueous cavity and lateral gate are reminiscent of features of protein-conducting conduits that facilitate polypeptide movement in the opposite direction-from the cytosol into or across membranes. Our results suggest that Hrd1 forms a retro-translocation channel for the movement of misfolded polypeptides through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.},

abstract = {The structure of wild-type bacteriophage T4 glutaredoxin (earlier called thioredoxin) in its oxidized form has been refined in a monoclinic crystal form at 2.0 {\AA} resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.209. A mutant T4 glutaredoxin gives orthorhombic crystals of better quality. The structure of this mutant has been solved by molecular replacement methods and refined at 1.45 {\AA} to an R-value of 0.175. In this mutant glutaredoxin, the active site residues Val15 and Tyr16 have been substituted by Gly and Pro, respectively, to mimic that of Escherichia coli thioredoxin. The main-chain conformation of the wild-type protein is similar in the two independently determined molecules in the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic crystals. On the other hand, side-chain conformations differ considerably between the two molecules due to heterologous packing interactions in the crystals. The structure of the mutant protein is very similar to the wild-type protein, except at mutated positions and at parts involved in crystal contacts. The active site disulfide bridge between Cys14 and Cys17 is located at the first turn of helix $\alpha$1. The torsion angles of these residues are similar to those of Escherichia coli thioredoxin. The torsion angle around the SS bond is smaller than that normally observed for disulfides: 58 °, 67 ° and 67 ° for wild-type glutaredoxin molecule A and B and mutant glutaredoxin, respectively. Each sulfur atom of the disulfide cysteines in T4 glutaredoxin forms a hydrogen bond to one main-chain nitrogen atom. The active site is shielded from solvent on one side by the $\beta$-carbon atoms of the cysteine residues plus side-chains of residues 7, 9, 21 and 33. From the opposite side, there is a cleft where the sulfur atom of Cys14 is accessible and can be attacked by a nucleophilic thiolate ion in the initial step of the reduction reaction. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Selective ion conduction across ion channel pores is central to cellular physiology. To understand the underlying principles of ion selectivity in tetrameric cation channels, we engineered a set of cation channel pores based on the nonselective NaK channel and determined their structures to high resolution. These structures showcase an ensemble of selectivity filters with a various number of contiguous ion binding sites ranging from 2 to 4, with each individual site maintaining a geometry and ligand environment virtually identical to that of equivalent sites in K(+) channel selectivity filters. Combined with single channel electrophysiology, we show that only the channel with four ion binding sites is K(+) selective, whereas those with two or three are nonselective and permeate Na(+) and K(+) equally well. These observations strongly suggest that the number of contiguous ion binding sites in a single file is the key determinant of the channel's selectivity properties and the presence of four sites in K(+) channels is essential for highly selective and efficient permeation of K(+) ions.},

First, we had previously generated (and pub- lished) models for most large protein families lacking experimentally determined structures using Rosetta guided by co-evolution based contact predictions, and for several targets these models proved better starting points for comparative modeling than any known crystal structure—our model database thus starts to fulfill one of the goals of the original protein structure initiative. Sec- ond, while our “human” group simply submitted ROBETTA models for most targets, for six targets expert intervention improved predictions considerably; the largest improvement was for T0886 where we correctly parsed two discontinuous domains guided by predicted contact maps to accu- rately identify a structural homolog of the same fold. Third, Rosetta all atom refinement followed by MD simulations led to consistent but small improvements when starting models were close to the native structure, and larger but less consistent improvements when starting models were fur- ther away.},

abstract = {The human retinoic acid receptor (hRAR) belongs to the family of nuclear receptors that regulate transcription in a ligand-dependent way. The isotypes RAR$\alpha$,$\beta$ and $\gamma$ are distinct pharmacological targets for retinoids that are involved in the treatment of various skin diseases and cancers, in particular breast cancer and acute promyelocytic leukemia. Therefore, synthetic retinoids have been developed aiming at isotype selectivity and reduced side-effects. We report the crystal structures of three complexes of the hRAR$\gamma$ ligand-binding domain (LBD) bound to agonist retinoids that possess selectivity either for RAR$\gamma$ (BMS184394) or for RAR$\beta$/$\gamma$ (CD564), or that are potent for all RAR-isotypes (panagonist BMS181156). The high resolution data (1.3-1.5 A) provide a description at the atomic level of the ligand pocket revealing the molecular determinants for the different degrees of ligand selectivity. The comparison of the complexes of the chemically closely related retinoids BMS184394 and CD564 shows that the side-chain of Met272 adopts different conformations depending on the presence of a hydrogen bond between its sulfur atom and the ligand. This accounts for their different isotype selectivity. On the other hand, the difference between the pan- and the RAR$\beta$,$\gamma$-selective agonist is probably due to a steric discrimination at the level of the 2-naphthoic acid moiety of CD564. Based on this study, we propose a model for a complex with the RAR$\gamma$-specific agonist CD666 that shows the possible applications for structure-based drug design of RAR isotype-selective retinoids.

abstract = {While genes are defined by sequence, in biological systems a protein's function is largely determined by its three-dimensional structure. Evolutionary information embedded within multiple sequence alignments provides a rich source of data for inferring structural constraints on macromolecules. Still, many proteins of interest lack sufficient numbers of related sequences, leading to noisy, error-prone residue-residue contact predictions. Here we introduce DeepContact, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that discovers co-evolutionary motifs and leverages these patterns to enable accurate inference of contact probabilities, particularly when few related sequences are available. DeepContact significantly improves performance over previous methods, including in the CASP12 blind contact prediction task where we achieved top performance with another CNN-based approach. Moreover, our tool converts hard-to-interpret coupling scores into probabilities, moving the field toward a consistent metric to assess contact prediction across diverse proteins. Through substantially improving the precision-recall behavior of contact prediction, DeepContact suggests we are near a paradigm shift in template-free modeling for protein structure prediction. Many protein structures of interest remain out of reach for both computational prediction and experimental determination. DeepContact learns patterns of co-evolution across thousands of experimentally determined structures, identifying conserved local motifs and leveraging this information to improve protein residue-residue contact predictions. DeepContact extracts additional information from the evolutionary couplings using its knowledge of co-evolution and structural space, while also converting coupling scores into probabilities that are comparable across protein sequences and alignments.},

abstract = {Since its release in September 2009, the structure-solution program ARCIMBOLDO, based on the combination of locating small model fragments such as polyalanine $\alpha$-helices with density modification with the program SHELXE in a multisolution frame, has evolved to incorporate other sources of stereochemical or experimental information. Fragments that are more sophisticated than the ubiquitous main-chain $\alpha$-helix can be proposed by modelling side chains onto the main chain or extracted from low-homology models, as locally their structure may be similar enough to the unknown one even if the conventional molecular-replacement approach has been unsuccessful. In such cases, the program may test a set of alternative models in parallel against a specified figure of merit and proceed with the selected one(s). Experimental information can be incorporated in three ways: searching within ARCIMBOLDO for an anomalous fragment against anomalous differences or MAD data or finding model fragments when an anomalous substructure has been determined with another program such as SHELXD or is subsequently located in the anomalous Fourier map calculated from the partial fragment phases. Both sources of information may be combined in the expansion process. In all these cases the key is to control the workflow to maximize the chances of success whilst avoiding the creation of an intractable number of parallel processes. A GUI has been implemented to aid the setup of suitable strategies within the various typical scenarios. In the present work, the practical application of ARCIMBOLDO within each of these scenarios is described through the distributed test cases.},

abstract = {We investigated how the register between adjacent beta-strands is specified using a series of mutants of the single-layer beta-sheet (SLB) in Borrelia OspA. The single-layer architecture of this system eliminates structural restraints imposed by a hydrophobic core, enabling us to address this question. A critical turn (turn 9/10) in the SLB was replaced with a segment with an intentional structural mismatch. Its crystal structure revealed a one-residue insertion into the central beta-strand (strand 9) of the SLB. This insertion triggered a surprisingly large-scale structural rearrangement: (i) the central strand (strand 9) was shifted by one residue, causing the strand to flip with respect to the adjacent beta-strands and thus completely disrupting the native side-chain contacts; (ii) the three-residue turn located on the opposite end of the beta-strand (turn 8/9) was pushed into its preceding beta-strand (strand 8); (iii) the register between strands 8 and 9 was shifted by three residues. Replacing the original sequence for turn 8/9 with a stronger turn motif restored the original strand register but still with a flipped beta-strand 9. The stability differences of these distinct structures were surprisingly small, consistent with an energy landscape where multiple low-energy states with different beta-sheet configurations exist. The observed conformations can be rationalized in terms of maximizing the number of backbone H-bonds. These results suggest that adjacent beta-strands "stick" through the use of factors that are not highly sequence specific and that beta-strands could slide back and forth relatively easily in the absence of external elements such as turns and tertiary packing.},

abstract = {Arf6 is an isoform of Arf that localizes at the periphery of the cell where it has an essential role in endocytotic pathways. Its function does not overlap with that of Arf1, although the two proteins share approximately 70{\%} sequence identity and they have switch regions, whose conformation depends on the nature of the guanine nucleotide, with almost identical sequences. The crystal structure of Arf6-GDP at 2.3 A shows that it has a conformation similar to that of Arf1-GDP, which cannot bind membranes with high affinity. Significantly, the switch regions of Arf6 deviate by 2-5 A from those of Arf1. These differences are a consequence of the shorter N-terminal linker of Arf6 and of discrete sequence changes between Arf6 and Arf1. Mutational analysis shows that one of the positions which differs between Arf1 and Arf6 affects the configuration of the nucleotide binding site and thus the nucleotide binding properties of the Arf variant. Altogether, our results provide a structural basis for understanding how Arf1 and Arf6 can be distinguished by their guanine nucleotide exchange factors and suggest a model for the nucleotide/membrane cycle of Arf6.},

abstract = {Nuclear hormone receptors are cytoplasm-based transcription factors that bind a ligand, translate to the nucleus and initiate gene transcription in complex with a co-activator such as TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2). For structural studies the co-activator is usually mimicked by a peptide of circa 13 residues, which for the largest part forms an $\alpha$-helix when bound to the receptor. The aim was to co-crystallize the glucocorticoid receptor in complex with a ligand and the TIF2 co-activator peptide. The 1.82 {\AA} resolution diffraction data obtained from the crystal could not be phased by molecular replacement using the known receptor structures. HPLC analysis of the crystals revealed the absence of the receptor and indicated that only the co-activator peptide was present. The self-rotation function displayed 13-fold rotational symmetry, which initiated an exhaustive but unsuccessful molecular-replacement approach using motifs of 13-fold symmetry such as $\alpha$- and $\beta$-barrels in various geometries. The structure was ultimately determined by using a single $\alpha$-helix and the software ARCIMBOLDO, which assembles fragments placed by PHASER before using them as seeds for density modification model building in SHELXE. Systematic variation of the helix length revealed upper and lower size limits for successful structure determination. A beautiful but unanticipated structure was obtained that forms superhelices with left-handed twist throughout the crystal, stabilized by ligand interactions. Together with the increasing diversity of structural elements in the Protein Data Bank the results from TIF2 confirm the potential of fragment-based molecular replacement to significantly accelerate the phasing step for native diffraction data at around 2 {\AA} resolution.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein homology detection, a fundamental problem in computational biology, is an indispensable step toward predicting protein structures and understanding protein functions. Despite the advances in recent decades on sequence alignment, threading and alignment-free methods, protein homology detection remains a challenging open problem. Recently, network methods that try to find transitive paths in the protein structure space demonstrate the importance of incorporating network information of the structure space. Yet, current methods merge the sequence space and the structure space into a single space, and thus introduce inconsistency in combining different sources of information. Method: We present a novel network-based protein homology detection method, CMsearch, based on cross-modal learning. Instead of exploring a single network built from the mixture of sequence and structure space information, CMsearch builds two separate networks to represent the sequence space and the structure space. It then learns sequence–structure correlation by simultaneously taking sequence information, structure information, sequence space information and structure space information into consideration. Results: We tested CMsearch on two challenging tasks, protein homology detection and protein structure prediction, by querying all 8332 PDB40 proteins. Our results demonstrate that CMsearch is insensitive to the similarity metrics used to define the sequence and the structure spaces. By using HMM–HMM alignment as the sequence similarity metric, CMsearch clearly outperforms state-of-the-art homology detection methods and the CASP-winning template-based protein structure prediction methods.

abstract = {In this article, we present COMSAT, a hybrid framework for residue contact prediction of transmembrane (TM) proteins, integrating a support vector machine (SVM) method and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method. COMSAT consists of two modules: COMSAT{\_}SVM which is trained mainly on position-specific scoring matrix features, and COMSAT{\_}MILP which is an ab initio method based on optimization models. Contacts predicted by the SVM model are ranked by SVM confidence scores, and a threshold is trained to improve the reliability of the predicted contacts. For TM proteins with no contacts above the threshold, COMSAT{\_}MILP is used. The proposed hybrid contact prediction scheme was tested on two independent TM protein sets based on the contact definition of 14 {\AA} between C$\alpha$-C$\alpha$ atoms. First, using a rigorous leave-one-protein-out cross validation on the training set of 90 TM proteins, an accuracy of 66.8{\%}, a coverage of 12.3{\%}, a specificity of 99.3{\%} and a Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.184 were obtained for residue pairs that are at least six amino acids apart. Second, when tested on a test set of 87 TM proteins, the proposed method showed a prediction accuracy of 64.5{\%}, a coverage of 5.3{\%}, a specificity of 99.4{\%} and a MCC of 0.106. COMSAT shows satisfactory results when compared with 12 other state-of-the-art predictors, and is more robust in terms of prediction accuracy as the length and complexity of TM protein increase.

In addition, Arg-31 was also proposed to participate in the catalysis based on the putative LTA(4) binding model.

abstract = {Contact-guided protein structure prediction methods are becoming more and more successful because of the latest advances in residue-residue contact prediction. To support contact-driven structure prediction, effective tools that can quickly build tertiary structural models of good quality from predicted contacts need to be developed. We develop an improved contact-driven protein modelling method, CONFOLD2, and study how it may be effectively used for ab initio protein structure prediction with predicted contacts as input. It builds models using various subsets of input contacts to explore the fold space under the guidance of a soft square energy function, and then clusters the models to obtain the top five models. CONFOLD2 obtains an average reconstruction accuracy of 0.57 TM-score for the 150 proteins in the PSICOV contact prediction dataset. When benchmarked on the CASP11 contacts predicted using CONSIP2 and CASP12 contacts predicted using Raptor-X, CONFOLD2 achieves a mean TM-score of 0.41 on both datasets. CONFOLD2 allows to quickly generate top five structural models for a protein sequence when its secondary structures and contacts predictions at hand.

We have solved four crystal structures of the C(2)B domain, one of them in the cation-free form at 1.50 A resolution, two in the Ca(2+)-bound form at 1.04 A (two bound Ca(2+) ions) and 1.65 A (three bound Ca(2+) ions) resolution and one in the Sr(2+)-bound form at 1.18 A (one bound Sr(2+) ion) resolution. The side chains of four highly conserved aspartic acids (D303, D309, D363, and D365) and two main chain oxygens (M302:O and Y364:O), together with water molecules, are in direct contact with two bound Ca(2+) ions (sites 1 and 2). At higher Ca(2+) concentrations, the side chain of N333 rotates and cooperates with D309 to generate a third Ca(2+) coordination site (site 3). Divalent cation binding sites 1 and 2 in the C(2)B domain were previously identified from NMR NOE patterns and titration studies, supplemented by site-directed mutation analysis. One difference between the crystal and NMR studies involves D371, which is not involved in coordination with any of the identified Ca(2+) sites in the crystal structures, while it is coordinated to Ca(2+) in site 2 in the NMR structure. In the presence of Sr(2+), which is also capable of triggering exocytosis, but with lower efficiency, only one cation binding site (site 1) was occupied in the crystallographic structure.},

abstract = {Motivation: Searching for structural similarity is a key issue of protein functional annotation. The maximum contact map overlap (CMO) is one of the possible measures of protein structure similarity. Exact and approximate methods known to optimize the CMO are computationally expensive and this hampers their applicability to large-scale comparison of protein structures. Results: In this article, we describe a heuristic algorithm (Al-Eigen) for finding a solution to the CMO problem. Our approach relies on the approximation of contact maps by eigendecomposition. We obtain good overlaps of two contact maps by computing the optimal global alignment of few principal eigenvectors. Our algorithm is simple, fast and its running time is independent of the amount of contacts in the map. Experimental testing indicates that the algorithm is comparable to exact CMO methods in terms of the overlap quality, to structural alignment methods in terms of structure similarity detection and it is fast enough to be suited for large-scale comparison of protein structures. Furthermore, our preliminary tests indicates that it is quite robust to noise, which makes it suitable for structural similarity detection also for noisy and incomplete contact maps.

abstract = {Recently exciting progress has been made on protein contact prediction, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual networks. This deep neural network allows us to model very complex sequence-contact relationship as well as long-range inter-contact correlation. Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on three datasets of 579 proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore{\textgreater}0.6) for 203 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 proteins, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models have much better quality than template-based models. Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore{\textgreater}0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we do not train our prediction models with any membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein prediction. Finally, in recent blind CAMEO benchmark our method successfully folded 5 test proteins with a novel fold.},

abstract = {2H phosphoesterases catalyze reactions on nucleotide substrates and contain two conserved histidine residues in the active site. Very limited information is currently available on the details of the active site and substrate/product binding during the catalytic cycle of these enzymes. We performed a comprehensive X-ray crystallographic study of mouse 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a membrane-associated enzyme present at high levels in the tetrapod myelin sheath. We determined crystal structures of the CNPase phosphodiesterase domain complexed with substrate, product, and phosphorothioate analogues. The data provide detailed information on the CNPase reaction mechanism, including substrate binding mode and coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule. Linked to the reaction, an open/close motion of the beta 5-alpha 7 loop is observed. The role of the N terminus of helix alpha 7-unique for CNPase in the 2H family-during the reaction indicates that 2H phosphoesterases differ in their respective reaction mechanisms despite the conserved catalytic residues. Furthermore, based on small-angle X-ray scattering, we present a model for the full-length enzyme, indicating that the two domains of CNPase form an elongated molecule. Finally, based on our structural data and a comprehensive bioinformatics study, we discuss the conservation of CNPase in various organisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Phaser is a program for phasing macromolecular crystal structures by both molecular replacement and experimental phasing methods. The novel phasing algorithms implemented in Phaser have been developed using maximum likelihood and multivariate statistics. For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have proved to be significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which account for correlations between F(+) and F(-), give better phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the phases given by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and anomalous differences DeltaF. One of the design concepts of Phaser was that it be capable of a high degree of automation. To this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be called directly from Python, although it can also be called using traditional CCP4 keyword-style input. Phaser is a platform for future development of improved phasing methods and their release, including source code, to the crystallographic community.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein fold recognition when appropriate, evolutionarily-related, structural templates can be identified is often trivial and may even be viewed as a solved problem. However in cases where no homologous structural templates can be detected, fold recognition is a notoriously dif- ficult problem (Moult et al., 2014). Here we present EigenTHREADER, a novel fold recognition method capable of identifying folds where no homologous structures can be identified. EigenTHREADER takes a query amino acid sequence, generates a map of intra-residue contacts, and then searches a library of contact maps of known structures. To allow the contact maps to be compared, we use eigenvector decomposition to resolve the principal eigenvectors these can then be aligned using standard dynamic programming algorithms. The approach is similar to the Al- Eigen approach of Di Lena et al. (2010), but with improvements made both to speed and accuracy. With this search strategy, EigenTHREADER does not depend directly on sequence homology be- tween the target protein and entries in the fold library to generate models. This in turn enables EigenTHREADER to correctly identify analogous folds where little or no sequence homology infor- mation is. Results: EigenTHREADER outperforms well-established fold recognition methods such as pGenTHREADER and HHSearch in terms of True Positive Rate in the difficult task of analogous fold recognition. This should allow template-based modelling to be extended to many new protein fam- ilies that were previously intractable to homology based fold recognition methods. Availability and implementation: All code used to generate these results and the computational protocol can be downloaded from https://github.com/DanBuchan/eigen{\_}scripts.

abstract = {Summary Clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) proteins mediate dendritic self-avoidance in neurons via specific homophilic interactions in their extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. We determined crystal structures of EC1-EC3, containing the homophilic specificity-determining region, of two mouse clustered Pcdh isoforms (Pcdh$\gamma$A1 and Pcdh$\gamma$C3) to investigate the nature of the homophilic interaction. Within the crystal lattices, we observe antiparallel interfaces consistent with a role in trans cell-cell contact. Antiparallel dimerization is supported by evolutionary correlations. Two interfaces, located primarily on EC2-EC3, involve distinctive clustered Pcdh structure and sequence motifs, lack predicted glycosylation sites, and contain residues highly conserved in orthologs but not paralogs, pointing toward their biological significance as homophilic interaction interfaces. These two interfaces are similar yet distinct, reflecting a possible difference in interaction architecture between clustered Pcdh subfamilies. These structures initiate a molecular understanding of clustered Pcdh assemblies that are required to produce functional neuronal networks.},

abstract = {Automatic iterative model (re-)building, as implemented in ARP/wARP and its new control system flex-wARP, is particularly well suited to follow structure solution by molecular replacement. More than 100 molecular-replacement solutions automatically solved by the BALBES software were submitted to three standard protocols in flex-wARP and the results were compared with final models from the PDB. Standard metrics were gathered in a systematic way and enabled the drawing of statistical conclusions on the advantages of each protocol. Based on this analysis, an empirical estimator was proposed that predicts how good the final model produced by flex-wARP is likely to be based on the experimental data and the quality of the molecular-replacement solution. To introduce the differences between the three flex-wARP protocols (keeping the complete search model, converting it to atomic coordinates but ignoring atom identities or using the electron-density map calculated from the molecular-replacement solution), two examples are also discussed in detail, focusing on the evolution of the models during iterative rebuilding. This highlights the diversity of paths that the flex-wARP control system can employ to reach a nearly complete and accurate model while actually starting from the same initial information.},

abstract = {For a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive C$\alpha$ positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted $\beta$-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues.

We developed a novel program, QUARK, for template-free protein structure prediction.

Full-length structure models are then assembled from fragments using replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations, which are guided by a composite knowledge-based force field. A number of novel energy terms and Monte Carlo movements are introduced and the particular contributions to enhancing the efficiency of both force field and search engine are analyzed in detail. QUARK prediction procedure is depicted and tested on the structure modeling of 145 nonhomologous proteins. Although no global templates are used and all fragments from experimental structures with template modeling score {\textgreater}0.5 are excluded, QUARK can successfully construct 3D models of correct folds in one-third cases of short proteins up to 100 residues. In the ninth community-wide Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction experiment, QUARK server outperformed the second and third best servers by 18 and 47{\{}{\%}{\}} based on the cumulative Z-score of global distance test-total scores in the FM category.

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

abstract = {We consider the differences between the many-pathway protein folding model derived from theoretical energy landscape considerations and the defined-pathway model derived from experiment. A basic tenet of the energy landscape model is that proteins fold through many heterogeneous pathways by way of amino acid-level dynamics biased toward selecting native-like interactions. The many pathways imagined in the model are not observed in the structure-formation stage of folding by experiments that would have found them, but they have now been detected and characterized for one protein in the initial prenucleation stage. Analysis presented here shows that these many microscopic trajectories are not distinct in any functionally significant way, and they have neither the structural information nor the biased energetics needed to select native vs. nonnative interactions during folding. The opposed defined-pathway model stems from experimental results that show that proteins are assemblies of small cooperative units called foldons and that a number of proteins fold in a reproducible pathway one foldon unit at a time. Thus, the same foldon interactions that encode the native structure of any given protein also naturally encode its particular foldon-based folding pathway, and they collectively sum to produce the energy bias toward native interactions that is necessary for efficient folding. Available information suggests that quantized native structure and stepwise folding coevolved in ancient repeat proteins and were retained as a functional pair due to their utility for solving the difficult protein folding problem.},

abstract = {Current methods for identification of domains within protein sequences require either structural information or the identification of homologous domain sequences in different sequence contexts. Knowledge of structural domain boundaries is important for fold recognition experiments and structural determination by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using the divide-and-conquer approach. Here, a new and conceptually simple method for the identification of structural domain boundaries in multiple protein sequence alignments is presented. Analysis of covariance at positions within the alignment is first used to predict 3D contacts. By the nature of the domain as an independent folding unit, inter-domain predicted contacts are fewer than intra-domain predicted contacts. By analysing all possible domain boundaries and constructing a smoothed profile of predicted contact density (PCD), true structural domain boundaries are predicted as local profile minima associated with low PCD. A training data set is constructed from 52 non-homologous two-domain protein sequences of known 3D structure and used to determine optimal parameters for the profile analysis. The alignments in the training data set contained 48 +/- 17 (mean +/- SD) sequences and lengths of 257 +/- 121 residues. Of the 47 alignments yielding predictions, 35{\%} of true domain boundaries are predicted to within 15 amino acids by the local profile minimum with the lowest profile value. Including predictions from the second- and third-lowest local minima increases the correct domain boundary coverage to 60{\%}, whereas the lowest five local minima cover 79{\%} of correct domain boundaries. Through further profile analysis, criteria are presented which reliably identify subsets of more accurate predictions. Retrospective analysis of CASP3 targets shows predictions of sufficient accuracy to enable dramatically improved fold recognition results. Finally, a prediction is made for geminivirus AL1 protein which is in full agreement with biochemical data, yielding a plausible, novel threading result.},

abstract = {In the last two years the Pfam database (http://pfam.xfam.org) has undergone a substantial reorganisation to reduce the effort involved in making a release, thereby permitting more frequent releases. Arguably the most significant of these changes is that Pfam is now primarily based on the UniProtKB reference proteomes, with the counts of matched sequences and species reported on the website restricted to this smaller set. Building families on reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the website, whilst still providing access to many important model organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however, still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB sequences can still be retrieved. Some Pfam entries (1.6{\%}) which have no matches to reference proteomes remain; we are working with UniProt to see if sequences from them can be incorporated into reference proteomes.

abstract = {TBX5, a member of the T-box transcription factor family, plays an important role in heart and limb development. More than 60 single point or deletion mutations of human TBX5 are associated with Holt-Oram syndrome that manifests itself as heart and limb malformations in 1 out of 100,000 live births. The majority of these mutations are located in the TBX5 T-box domain. We solved the crystal structures of the human TBX5 T-box domain in its DNA-unbound form and in complex with a natural DNA target site allowing for the first time the comparison between unbound and DNA-bound forms. Our analysis identifies a 310-helix at the C-terminus of the T-box domain as an inducible recognition element, critically required for the interaction with DNA, as it only forms upon DNA binding and is unstructured in the DNA-unbound form. Using circular dichroism, we characterized the thermal stability of six TBX5 mutants containing single point mutations in the T-box domain (M74V, G80R, W121G, G169R, T223M, and R237W) and compared them with wild-type protein. Mutants G80R and W121G show drastically reduced thermal stability, while the other mutants only show a marginal stability decrease. For all TBX5 mutants, binding affinities to specific and nonspecific DNA sequences were determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. All TBX5 mutants show reduced binding affinities to a specific DNA target site, although to various degrees. Interestingly, all tested TBX5 mutants differ in their ability to bind unspecific DNA, indicating that both sequence-specific and unspecific binding might contribute to the misregulation of target gene expression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance within a wide range of infectious agents is a severe and growing public health threat. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are among the leading alternatives to current antibiotics, exhibiting broad spectrum activity. Their activity is determined by numerous properties such as cationic charge, amphipathicity, size, and amino acid composition. Currently, only around 10{\%} of known AMP sequences have experimentally solved structures. To improve our understanding of the AMP structural universe we have carried out large scale ab initio 3D modeling of structurally uncharacterized AMPs that revealed similarities between predicted folds of the modeled sequences and structures of characterized AMPs. Two of the peptides whose models matched known folds are Lebocin Peptide 1A (LP1A) and Odorranain M, predicted to form beta-hairpins but, interestingly, to lack the intramolecular disulfide bonds, cation-pi or aromatic interactions that generally stabilize such AMP structures. Other examples include Ponericin Q42, Latarcin 4a, Kassinatuerin 1, Ceratotoxin D, and CPF-B1 peptide, which have alpha-helical folds, as well as mixed alphabeta folds of human Histatin 2 peptide and Garvicin A which are, to the best of our knowledge, the first linear alphabetabeta fold AMPs lacking intramolecular disulfide bonds. In addition to fold matches to experimentally derived structures, unique folds were also obtained, namely for Microcin M and Ipomicin. These results help in understanding the range of protein scaffolds that naturally bear antimicrobial activity and may facilitate protein design efforts towards better AMPs.},

abstract = {Insect odorant receptors (ORs) comprise an enormous protein family that translates environmental chemical signals into neuronal electrical activity. These heptahelical receptors are proposed to function as ligand-gated ion channels and/or to act metabotropically as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Resolving their signalling mechanism has been hampered by the lack of tertiary structural information and primary sequence similarity to other proteins. We use amino acid evolutionary covariation across these ORs to define restraints on structural proximity of residue pairs, which permit de novo generation of three-dimensional models. The validity of our analysis is supported by the location of functionally important residues in highly constrained regions of the protein. Importantly, insect OR models exhibit a distinct transmembrane domain packing arrangement to that of canonical GPCRs, establishing the structural unrelatedness of these receptor families. The evolutionary couplings and models predict odour binding and ion conduction domains, and provide a template for rationale structure-activity dissection.},

abstract = {Motivation: Recent CASP experiments have witnessed exciting progress on folding large-size non-humongous proteins with the assistance of co-evolution based contact predictions. The success is however anecdotal due to the requirement of the contact prediction methods for the high volume of sequence homologs that are not available to most of the non-humongous protein targets. Development of efficient methods that can generate balanced and reliable contact maps for differ-ent type of protein targets is essential to enhance the success rate of the ab initio protein structure prediction. Results: We developed a new pipeline, NeBcon, which uses the nave Bayes classifier (NBC) the-orem to combine eight state of the art contact methods that are built from co-evolution and machine learning approaches. The posterior probabilities of the NBC model are then trained with intrinsic structural features through neural network learning for the final contact map prediction. NeBcon was tested on 98 non-redundant proteins, which improves the accuracy of the best co-evolution based meta-server predictor by 22{\%}; the magnitude of the improvement increases to 45{\%} for the hard targets that lack sequence and structural homologs in the databases. Detailed data analysis showed that the major contribution to the improvement is due to the optimized NBC combination of the complementary information from both co-evolution and machine learning pre-dictions. The neural network training also helps to improve the coupling of the NBC posterior prob-ability and the intrinsic structural features, which were found particularly important for the proteins that do not have sufficient number of homologous sequences to derive reliable co-evolution profiles.

The structure establishes AqpM as being in a unique subdivision between the two major subdivisions of aquaporins, the water-selective aquaporins, and the water-plus-glycerol-conducting aquaglyceroporins. In AqpM, isoleucine replaces a key histidine residue found in the lumen of water channels, which becomes a glycine residue in aquaglyceroporins. As a result of this and other side-chain substituents in the walls of the channel, the channel is intermediate in size and exhibits differentially tuned electrostatics when compared with the other subfamilies.},

abstract = {Consensus protein design is a rapid and reliable technique for the improvement of protein stability, which relies on the use of homologous protein sequences. To enhance the stability of a fibronectin type III (FN3) domain, consensus design was employed using an alignment of 2123 sequences. The resulting FN3 domain, FN3con, has unprecedented stability, with a melting temperature {\textgreater}100°C, a $\Delta$G D−N of 15.5 kcal mol −1 and a greatly reduced unfolding rate compared with wild-type. To deter-mine the underlying molecular basis for stability, an X-ray crystal structure of FN3con was deter-mined to 2.0 {\AA} and compared with other FN3 domains of varying stabilities. The structure of FN3con reveals significantly increased salt bridge interactions that are cooperatively networked, and a highly optimized hydrophobic core. Molecular dynamics simulations of FN3con and compari-son structures show the cooperative power of electrostatic and hydrophobic networks in improving FN3con stability. Taken together, our data reveal that FN3con stability does not result from a single mechanism, but rather the combination of several features and the removal of non-conserved, unfavorable interactions. The large number of sequences employed in this study has most likely enhanced the robustness of the consensus design, which is now possible due to the increased se-quence availability in the post-genomic era. These studies increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern stability and demonstrate the rising potential for enhancing stability via the consensus method.},

Structures are here presented of the c(10) ring from Saccharomyces cerevisiae determined at pH 8.3, 6.1 and 5.5, at resolutions of 2.0 {\AA}, 2.5 {\AA} and 2.0 {\AA}, respectively. The overall structure of this mitochondrial c-ring is similar to known homologs, except that the essential carboxylate, Glu59, adopts an open extended conformation.

abstract = {The metabolic pathway by which 4-chlorobenzoate is degraded to 4-hydroxybenzoate in the soil-dwelling microbe Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3 consists of three enzymes including 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase. The structure of the unbound form of this thioesterase has been shown to contain the so-called "hot dog" fold with a large helix packed against a five-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. To address the manner in which the enzyme accommodates the substrate within the active site, two inhibitors have been synthesized, namely 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA and 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA. Here we describe the structural analyses of the enzyme complexed with these two inhibitors determined and refined to 1.5 and 1.8 A resolution, respectively. These studies indicate that only one protein side chain, Ser(91), participates directly in ligand binding. All of the other interactions between the protein and the inhibitors are mediated through backbone peptidic NH groups, carbonyl oxygens, and/or solvents. The structures of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes suggest that both a hydrogen bond and the positive end of a helix dipole moment serve to polarize the electrons away from the carbonyl carbon of the acyl group, thereby making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Additionally, these studies demonstrate that the carboxylate group of Asp(17) is approximately 3.2 A from the carbonyl carbon of the acyl group. To address the role of Asp(17), the structure of the site-directed mutant protein D17N with bound substrate has also been determined. Taken together, these investigations suggest that the reaction mechanism may proceed through an acyl enzyme intermediate.},

abstract = {Motivation: Recently it has been shown that the quality of protein contact prediction from evolutionary information can be improved significantly if direct and indirect information is separated. Given sufficiently large protein families, the contact predictions contain sufficient information to predict the structure of many protein families. However, since the first studies contact prediction methods have improved. Here, we ask how much the final models are improved if improved contact predictions are used. Results: In a small benchmark of 15 proteins, we show that the TM-scores of top-ranked models are improved by on average 33{\%} using PconsFold compared with the original version of EVfold. In a larger benchmark, we find that the quality is improved with 15-30{\%} when using PconsC in comparison with earlier contact prediction methods. Further, using Rosetta instead of CNS does not significantly improve global model accuracy, but the chemistry of models generated with Rosetta is improved. Availability: PconsFold is a fully automated pipeline for ab initio protein structure prediction based on evolutionary information. PconsFold is based on PconsC contact prediction and uses the Rosetta folding protocol. Due to its modularity, the contact prediction tool can be easily exchanged.

abstract = {Evolutionary pressure on residue interactions, intramolecular or intermolecular, that are important for protein structure or function can lead to covariance between the two positions. Recent methodological advances allow much more accurate contact predictions to be derived from this evolutionary covariance signal. The practical application of contact predictions has largely been confined to structural bioinformatics, yet, as this work seeks to demonstrate, the data can be of enormous value to the structural biologist working in X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM or NMR. Integrative structural bioinformatics packages such as Rosetta can already exploit contact predictions in a variety of ways. The contribution of contact predictions begins at construct design, where structural domains may need to be expressed separately and contact predictions can help to predict domain limits. Structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) benefits from contact predictions in diverse ways: in difficult cases, more accurate search models can be constructed using ab initio modelling when predictions are available, while intermolecular contact predictions can allow the construction of larger, oligomeric search models. Furthermore, MR using supersecondary motifs or large-scale screens against the PDB can exploit information, such as the parallel or antiparallel nature of any $\beta$-strand pairing in the target, that can be inferred from contact predictions. Contact information will be particularly valuable in the determination of lower resolution structures by helping to assign sequence register. In large complexes, contact information may allow the identity of a protein responsible for a certain region of density to be determined and then assist in the orientation of an available model within that density. In NMR, predicted contacts can provide long-range information to extend the upper size limit of the technique in a manner analogous but complementary to experimental methods. Finally, predicted contacts can distinguish between biologically relevant interfaces and mere lattice contacts in a final crystal structure, and have potential in the identification of functionally important regions and in foreseeing the consequences of mutations.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Co-evolution methods have been used as contact predictors to identify pairs of residues that share spatial proximity. Such contact predictors have been compared in terms of the precision of their predictions, but there is no study that compares their usefulness to model generation. RESULTS: We compared eight different co-evolution methods for a set of ∼3500 proteins and found that metaPSICOV stage 2 produces, on average, the most precise predictions. Precision of all the methods is dependent on SCOP class, with most methods predicting contacts in all $\alpha$ and membrane proteins poorly. The contact predictions were then used to assist in de novo model generation. We found that it was not the method with the highest average precision, but rather metaPSICOV stage 1 predictions that consistently led to the best models being produced. Our modelling results show a correlation between the proportion of predicted long range contacts that are satisfied on a model and its quality. We used this proportion to effectively classify models as correct/incorrect; discarding decoys classified as incorrect led to an enrichment in the proportion of good decoys in our final ensemble by a factor of seven. For 17 out of the 18 cases where correct answers were generated, the best models were not discarded by this approach. We were also able to identify eight cases where no correct decoy had been generated. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Data is available for download from: http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/resources.},

Here we describe a new approach to refining protein structure models that focuses sampling in regions most likely to contain errors while allowing the whole structure to relax in a physically realistic all-atom force field. In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models.},

A multiprotein assembly binds and processes the dsDNA to import one strand and degrade another yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are relatively poorly understood. Here distant relationships of domains in Competence protein EC (ComEC) of Bacillus subtilis (Uniprot: P39695) were characterised. DNA-protein interactions were investigated in silico by analysing models for structural conservation, surface electrostatics and structure-based DNA binding propensity; and by data-driven macromolecular docking of DNA to models. Our findings suggest that the DUF4131 domain contains a cryptic DNA-binding OB fold domain and that the $\beta$- lactamase-like domain is the hitherto cryptic competence nuclease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ever since the ground-breaking work of Anfinsen et al. in which a denatured protein was found to refold to its native state, it has been frequently stated by the protein fold prediction community that all the information required for protein folding lies in the amino acid sequence. Recent in vitro experiments and in silico computational studies, however, have shown that cotranslation may affect the folding pathway of some proteins, especially those of ancient folds. In this paper aspects of cotranslational folding have been incorporated into a protein structure prediction algorithm by adapting the Rosetta program to fold proteins as the nascent chain elongates. This makes it possible to conduct a pairwise comparison of folding accuracy, by comparing folds created sequentially from each end of the protein. RESULTS: A single main result emerged: in 94{\%} of proteins analyzed, following the sense of translation, from N-terminus to C-terminus, produced better predictions than following the reverse sense of translation, from the C-terminus to N-terminus. Two secondary results emerged. First, this superiority of N-terminus to C-terminus folding was more marked for proteins showing stronger evidence of cotranslation and second, an algorithm following the sense of translation produced predictions comparable to, and occasionally better than, Rosetta. CONCLUSIONS: There is a directionality effect in protein fold prediction. At present, prediction methods appear to be too noisy to take advantage of this effect; as techniques refine, it may be possible to draw benefit from a sequential approach to protein fold prediction.},

abstract = {Patterns of interacting amino acids are so preserved within protein families that the sole analysis of evolutionary comutations can identify pairs of contacting residues. It is also known that evolution conserves functional dynamics, i.e., the concerted motion or displacement of large protein regions or domains. Is it, therefore, possible to use a pure sequence-based analysis to identify these dynamical domains? To address this question, we introduce here a general coevolutionary coupling analysis strategy and apply it to a curated sequence database of hundreds of protein families. For most families, the sequence-based method partitions amino acids into a few clusters. When viewed in the context of the native structure, these clusters have the signature characteristics of viable protein domains: They are spatially separated but individually compact. They have a direct functional bearing too, as shown for various reference cases. We conclude that even large-scale structural and functionally related properties can be recovered from inference methods applied to evolutionary-related sequences. The method introduced here is available as a software package and web server (spectrus.sissa.it/spectrus-evo{\_}webserver).},

abstract = {Correctly positioning ideal protein fragments by molecular replacement presents an attractive method for obtaining preliminary phases when no template structure for molecular replacement is available. This has been exploited in several existing pipelines. This paper presents a new pipeline, named Fragon , in which fragments (ideal $\alpha$-helices or $\beta$-strands) are placed using Phaser and the phases calculated from these coordinates are then improved by the density-modification methods provided by ACORN . The reliable scoring algorithm provided by ACORN identifies success. In these cases, the resulting phases are usually of sufficient quality to enable automated model building of the entire structure. Fragon was evaluated against two test sets comprising mixed $\alpha$/$\beta$ folds and all-$\beta$ folds at resolutions between 1.0 and 1.7 {\AA}. Success rates of 61{\%} for the mixed $\alpha$/$\beta$ test set and 30{\%} for the all-$\beta$ test set were achieved. In almost 70{\%} of successful runs, fragment placement and density modification took less than 30 min on relatively modest four-core desktop computers. In all successful runs the best set of phases enabled automated model building with ARP / wARP to complete the structure.},

abstract = {Catabolism of host cholesterol is critical to the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a potential target for novel therapeutics. KstR2, a TetR family repressor (TFR), regulates the expression of 15 genes encoding enzymes that catabolize the last half of the cholesterol molecule, represented by 3a$\alpha$-H-4$\alpha$(3'-propanoate)-7a$\beta$-methylhexahydro-1,5-indane-dione (HIP). Binding of KstR2 to its operator sequences is relieved upon binding of HIP-CoA. A 1.6-{\AA} resolution crystal structure of the KstR2(Mtb){\textperiodcentered}HIP-CoA complex reveals that the KstR2(Mtb) dimer accommodates two molecules of HIP-CoA. Each ligand binds in an elongated cleft spanning the dimerization interface such that the HIP and CoA moieties interact with different KstR2(Mtb) protomers. In isothermal titration calorimetry studies, the dimer bound 2 eq of HIP-CoA with high affinity (K(d) = 80 ± 10 nm) but bound neither HIP nor CoASH. Substitution of Arg-162 or Trp-166, residues that interact, respectively, with the diphosphate and HIP moieties of HIP-CoA, dramatically decreased the affinity of KstR2(Mtb) for HIP-CoA but not for its operator sequence. The variant of R162M that decreased the affinity for HIP-CoA ($\Delta$$\Delta$G = 13 kJ mol(-1)) is consistent with the loss of three hydrogen bonds as indicated in the structural data. A 24-bp operator sequence bound two dimers of KstR2. Structural comparisons with a ligand-free rhodococcal homologue and a DNA-bound homologue suggest that HIP-CoA induces conformational changes of the DNA-binding domains of the dimer that preclude their proper positioning in the major groove of DNA. The results provide insight into KstR2-mediated regulation of expression of steroid catabolic genes and the determinants of ligand binding in TFRs.},

abstract = {Galectins have essential roles in pathological states including cancer, inflammation, angiogenesis and microbial infections. Endogenous receptors include members of the lacto- and neolacto-series glycosphingolipids present on mammalian cells and contain the tetrasaccharides lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) that form their core structural components and also ganglio-series glycosphingolipids. We present crystallographic structures of the carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin-3, both wild type and a mutant (K176L) that influenced ligand affinity, in complex with LNT, LNnT and acetamido ganglioside a-GM3($\alpha$2,3-sialyllactose). Key structural features revealed include galectin-3's demonstration of a binding mode towards gangliosides distinct from that to the lacto/neolacto- glycosphingolipids, with its capacity for recognising the core $\beta$-galactoside region being challenged when the core oligosaccharide epitope of ganglio-series glycosphingolipids (GM3) is embedded within particular higher-molecular-weight glycans. The lacto- and neolacto- glycosphingolipids revealed different orientations of their terminal galactose in the galectin-3-bound LNT and LNnT structures that has significant ramifications for the capacity of galectin-3 to interact with higher-order lacto/neolacto-series glycosphingolipids such as ABH blood group antigens and the HNK-1 antigen that is common on leukocytes. LNnT also presents an important model for poly-N-acetyllactosamine-containing glycans and provides insight into galectin-3's accommodation of extended oligosaccharides such as the poly-N-acetyllactosamine-modified N- and O-glycans that, via galectin-3 interaction, facilitate progression of lung and bladder cancers, respectively. These findings provide the first atomic detail of galectin-3's interactions with the core structures of mammalian glycosphingolipids, providing information important in understanding the capacity of galectin-3 to engage with receptors identified as facilitators of major disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aquaporin family of channels was defined based on the inhibition of water transport by mercurial compounds. Despite the important role of mercurials, little is known about the structural changes involved upon mercury binding leading to channel inhibition. To elucidate the mechanism we designed a mutant, T183C, of aquaporin Z (AqpZ) patterned after the known mercury-sensitive site of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and determined the X-ray crystal structures of the unbound and mercury blocked states. Superposition of the two structures shows no conformational rearrangement upon mercury binding. In the blocked structure, there are two mercury sites, one bound to Cys183 and occluding the pore, and a second, also bound to the same cysteine but found buried in an interstitial cavity. To test the mechanism of blockade we designed a different mutant, L170C, to produce a more effective mercury block at the pore site. In a dose-response inhibition study, this mutant was 20 times more sensitive to mercury than wild-type AqpZ and four times more sensitive than T183C. The X-ray structure of L170C shows four mercury atoms at, or near, the pore site defined in the T183C structure and no structural change upon mercury binding. Thus, we elucidate a steric inhibition mechanism for this important class of channels by mercury. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ab initio phasing of macromolecular structures, from the native intensities alone with no experimental phase information or previous particular structural knowledge, has been the object of a long quest, limited by two main barriers: structure size and resolution of the data. Current approaches to extend the scope of ab initio phasing include use of the Patterson function, density modification and data extrapolation. The authors' approach relies on the combination of locating model fragments such as polyalanine $\alpha$-helices with the program PHASER and density modification with the program SHELXE. Given the difficulties in discriminating correct small substructures, many putative groups of fragments have to be tested in parallel; thus calculations are performed in a grid or supercomputer. The method has been named after the Italian painter Arcimboldo, who used to compose portraits out of fruit and vegetables. With ARCIMBOLDO, most collections of fragments remain a 'still-life', but some are correct enough for density modification and main-chain tracing to reveal the protein's true portrait. Beyond $\alpha$-helices, other fragments can be exploited in an analogous way: libraries of helices with modelled side chains, $\beta$-strands, predictable fragments such as DNA-binding folds or fragments selected from distant homologues up to libraries of small local folds that are used to enforce nonspecific tertiary structure; thus restoring the ab initio nature of the method. Using these methods, a number of unknown macromolecules with a few thousand atoms and resolutions around 2 {\AA} have been solved. In the 2014 release, use of the program has been simplified. The software mediates the use of massive computing to automate the grid access required in difficult cases but may also run on a single multicore workstation (http://chango.ibmb.csic.es/ARCIMBOLDO{\_}LITE) to solve straightforward cases.},

However, designing functional assays for these methods is challenging, and systematic testing of all combinations is impossible, so robust methods to predict the effects of genetic variation are needed. Most prediction methods exploit evolutionary sequence conservation but do not consider the interdependencies of residues or bases. We present EVmutation, an unsupervised statistical method for predicting the effects of mutations that explicitly captures residue dependencies between positions. We validate EVmutation by comparing its predictions with outcomes of high-throughput mutagenesis experiments and measurements of human disease mutations and show that it outperforms methods that do not account for epistasis. EVmutation can be used to assess the quantitative effects of mutations in genes of any organism. We provide pre-computed predictions for ∼7,000 human proteins at http://evmutation.org/.},

abstract = {Molecular replacement, one of the general methods to solve the crystallographic phase problem, relies on the availability of suitable models to be placed in the unit cell of the unknown structure in order to provide initial phases. ARCIMBOLDO, originally conceived for ab initio phasing, operates at the limit of this approach, using small, very accurate fragments such as polyalanine alpha-helices. A distant homolog may contain such accurate building blocks, while it may not be evident which substructure will be most suitable purely from the degree of conservation. Trying out all alternative possibilities in a systematic way is computationally expensive, even if effective. In the present work, the solution of the previously unknown structure of MltE, an outer membrane-anchored endolytic peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylase from Escherichia coli is described. The asymmetric unit contains a dimer of this 194 aminoacids protein. The closest available homolog was the catalytic domain of Slt70 (PDB code 1QTE). Originally, this template was used omitting contiguous spans of aminoacids and setting as many ARCIMBOLDO runs as models, each aiming to locate two copies sequentially with PHASER. Fragment trimming against the correlation coefficient prior to expansion through density modification and autotracing in SHELXE was essential. Analysis of the figures of merit led to the strategy to optimize the search model against the experimental data now implemented within ARCIMBOLDO-SHREDDER (http://chango.ibmb.csic.es/SHREDDER). In this strategy, the initial template is systematically shredded and fragments are scored against each unique solution of the rotation function. Results are combined into a score per residue and the template is trimmed accordingly. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

These approaches have not only benefited from advances in the computational software and architectures, but have also been assisted by a prodigious rise in the number of both the molecular sequences and experimentally determined membrane protein structures. The former, in part stimulated by metagenomics sequencing techniques, has led to an increased prediction accuracy for the computationally folded protein structures. The latter, assisted by improvements in structural biology approaches, has led to longer, larger and more complex molecular simulations of membrane proteins; many of which have greater relevance to human disease. Here I describe the methods for predicting a membrane protein structure from sequence, discuss the approaches to configure membrane protein simulations and detail the techniques used to identify and characterize specific lipid binding sites to membrane protein structures.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Protein contact prediction is important for protein structure and functional study. Both evolutionary coupling (EC) analysis and supervised machine learning methods have been developed, making use of different information sources. However, contact prediction is still challenging especially for proteins without a large number of sequence homologs. RESULTS This article presents a group graphical lasso (GGL) method for contact prediction that integrates joint multi-family EC analysis and supervised learning to improve accuracy on proteins without many sequence homologs. Different from existing single-family EC analysis that uses residue coevolution information in only the target protein family, our joint EC analysis uses residue coevolution in both the target family and its related families, which may have divergent sequences but similar folds. To implement this, we model a set of related protein families using Gaussian graphical models and then coestimate their parameters by maximum-likelihood, subject to the constraint that these parameters shall be similar to some degree. Our GGL method can also integrate supervised learning methods to further improve accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods on proteins without thousands of sequence homologs, and that our method performs better on both conserved and family-specific contacts.

abstract = {The advent of high accuracy residue-residue intra-protein contact prediction methods enabled a significant boost in the quality of de novo structure predictions. Here, we investigate the potential benefits of combining a well-established fragment-based folding algorithm – FRAGFOLD, with PSICOV, a contact prediction method which uses sparse inverse covariance estimation to identify co-varying sites in multiple sequence alignments. Using a comprehensive set of 150 diverse globular target proteins, up to 266 amino acids in length, we are able to address the effectiveness and some limitations of such approaches to globular proteins in practice. Overall we find that using fragment assembly with both statistical potentials and predicted contacts is significantly better than either statistical potentials or contacts alone. Results show up to nearly 80{\%} of correct predictions (TM-score ≥0.5) within analysed dataset and a mean TM-score of 0.54. Unsuccessful modelling cases emerged either from conformational sampling problems, or insufficient contact prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, a strong dependency of the quality of final models on the fraction of satisfied predicted long-range contacts was observed. This not only highlights the importance of these contacts on determining the protein fold, but also (combined with other ensemble-derived qualities) provides a powerful guide as to the choice of correct models and the global quality of the selected model. A proposed quality assessment scoring function achieves 0.93 precision and 0.77 recall for the discrimination of correct folds on our dataset of decoys. These findings suggest the approach is well-suited for blind predictions on a variety of globular proteins of unknown 3D structure, provided that enough homologous sequences are available to construct a large and accurate multiple sequence alignment for the initial contact prediction step.},

abstract = {It has been known even since relatively few structures had been solved that longer protein chains often contain multiple domains, which may fold separately and play the role of reusable functional modules found in many contexts. In many structural biology tasks, in particular structure prediction, it is of great use to be able to identify domains within the structure and analyze these regions separately. However, when using sequence data alone this task has proven exceptionally difficult, with relatively little improvement over the naive method of choosing boundaries based on size distributions of observed domains. The recent significant improvement in contact prediction provides a new source of information for domain prediction. We test several methods for using this information including a kernel smoothing-based approach and methods based on building alpha-carbon models and compare performance with a length-based predictor, a homology search method and four published sequence-based predictors: DOMCUT, DomPRO, DLP-SVM, and SCOOBY-DOmain. We show that the kernel-smoothing method is significantly better than the other ab initio predictors when both single-domain and multidomain targets are considered and is not significantly different to the homology-based method. Considering only multidomain targets the kernel-smoothing method outperforms all of the published methods except DLP-SVM. The kernel smoothing method therefore represents a potentially useful improvement to ab initio domain prediction.},

abstract = {Active DNA demethylation in mammals occurs via hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the ten-eleven translocation family of proteins (TETs). 5hmC residues in DNA can be further oxidized by TETs to 5-carboxylcytosines and/or deaminated by the Activation Induced Deaminase/Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme complex family proteins to 5-hydromethyluracil (5hmU). Excision and replacement of these intermediates is initiated by DNA glycosylases such as thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG), methyl-binding domain protein 4 (MBD4) and single-strand specific monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 in the base excision repair pathway. Here, we report detailed biochemical and structural characterization of human MBD4 which contains mismatch-specific TDG activity. Full-length as well as catalytic domain (residues 426-580) of human MBD4 (MBD4(cat)) can remove 5hmU when opposite to G with good efficiency. Here, we also report six crystal structures of human MBD4(cat): an unliganded form and five binary complexes with duplex DNA containing a T•G, 5hmU•G or AP•G (apurinic/apyrimidinic) mismatch at the target base pair. These structures reveal that MBD4(cat) uses a base flipping mechanism to specifically recognize thymine and 5hmU. The recognition mechanism of flipped-out 5hmU bases in MBD4(cat) active site supports the potential role of MBD4, together with TDG, in maintenance of genome stability and active DNA demethylation in mammals.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)] and its immediate breakdown product PtdIns(3,4)P(2) function as second messengers in growth factor- and insulin-induced signalling pathways. One of the ways that these 3-phosphoinositides are known to regulate downstream signalling events is by attracting proteins that possess specific PtdIns-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domains to the plasma membrane. Many of these proteins, such as protein kinase B, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and the dual adaptor for phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositides (DAPP1) interact with both PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and PtdIns(3,4)P(2) with similar affinity. Recently, a new PH-domain-containing protein, termed tandem PH-domain-containing protein (TAPP) 1, was described which is the first protein reported to bind PtdIns(3,4)P(2) specifically. Here we describe the crystal structure of the PtdIns(3,4)P(2)-binding PH domain of TAPP1 at 1.4 A (1 A=0.1 nm) resolution in complex with an ordered citrate molecule. The structure is similar to the known structure of the PH domain of DAPP1 around the D-3 and D-4 inositol-phosphate-binding sites. However, a glycine residue adjacent to the D-5 inositol-phosphate-binding site in DAPP1 is substituted for a larger alanine residue in TAPP1, which also induces a conformational change in the neighbouring residues. We show that mutation of this glycine to alanine in DAPP1 converts DAPP1 into a TAPP1-like PH domain that only interacts with PtdIns(3,4)P(2), whereas the alanine to glycine mutation in TAPP1 permits the TAPP1 PH domain to interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3).},

However, a high background composed of random noise and phylogenetic components interferes with the identification of coevolving positions. RESULTS: We have developed a rapid, simple and general method based on information theory that accurately estimates the level of background mutual information for each pair of positions in a given protein family. Removal of this background results in a metric, MIp, that correctly identifies substantially more coevolving positions in protein families than any existing method. A significant fraction of these positions coevolve strongly with one or only a few positions. The vast majority of such position pairs are in contact in representative structures. The identification of strongly coevolving position pairs can be used to impose significant structural limitations and should be an important additional constraint for ab initio protein folding.

abstract = {Detection, immobilization and purification of carbohydrates can be done using molecular probes that specifically bind to targeted carbohydrate epitopes. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are discrete parts of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes that can be engineered to bind and detect specifically a number of carbohydrates. Design and engineering of CBMs have benefited greatly from structural studies that have helped us to decipher the basis for specificity in carbohydrate-protein interactions. However, more studies are needed to predict which modifications in a CBM would generate probes with predetermined binding properties. In this report, we present the crystal structures of two highly related engineered CBMs with different binding specificity profiles: X-2, which is specific for xylans and the L110F mutant of X-2, which binds xyloglucans and $\beta$-glucans in addition to xylans. The structures of the modules were solved both in the apo form and complexed with oligomers of xylose, as well as with an oligomer of glucose in the case of X-2 L110F. The mutation, leucine to phenylalanine, converting the specific module into a cross-reactive one, introduces a crucial hydrogen-$\pi$ interaction that allows the mutant to retain glucan-based ligands. The cross-reactivity of X-2 L110F is furthermore made possible by the plasticity of the protein, in particular, of residue R142, which permits accommodation of an extra hydroxymethyl group present in cellopentaose and not xylopentaose. Altogether, this study shows, in structural detail, altered protein-carbohydrate interactions that have high impact on the binding properties of a carbohydrate probe but are introduced through simple mutagenesis.},

abstract = {Direct prediction of protein structure from sequence is a challenging problem. An effective approach is to break it up into independent sub-problems. These sub-problems such as prediction of protein secondary structure can then be solved independently. In a previous study, we found that an iterative use of predicted secondary structure and backbone torsion angles can further improve secondary structure and torsion angle prediction. In this study, we expand the iterative features to include solvent accessible surface area and backbone angles and dihedrals based on C$\alpha$ atoms. By using a deep learning neural network in three iterations, we achieved 82{\%} accuracy for secondary structure prediction, 0.76 for the correlation coefficient between predicted and actual solvent accessible surface area, 19° and 30° for mean absolute errors of backbone $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles, respectively, and 8° and 32° for mean absolute errors of C$\alpha$-based $\theta$ and $\tau$ angles, respectively, for an independent test dataset of 1199 proteins. The accuracy of the method is slightly lower for 72 CASP 11 targets but much higher than those of model structures from current state-of-the-art techniques. This suggests the potentially beneficial use of these predicted properties for model assessment and ranking.},

abstract = {Coiled-coil protein folds are among the most abundant in nature. These folds consist of long wound $\alpha$-helices and are architecturally simple, but paradoxically their crystallographic structures are notoriously difficult to solve with molecular-replacement techniques. The program AMPLE can solve crystal structures by molecular replacement using ab initio search models in the absence of an existent homologous protein structure. AMPLE has been benchmarked on a large and diverse test set of coiled-coil crystal structures and has been found to solve 80{\%} of all cases. Successes included structures with chain lengths of up to 253 residues and resolutions down to 2.9 {\AA}, considerably extending the limits on size and resolution that are typically tractable by ab initio methodologies. The structures of two macromolecular complexes, one including DNA, were also successfully solved using their coiled-coil components. It is demonstrated that both the ab initio modelling and the use of ensemble search models contribute to the success of AMPLE by comparison with phasing attempts using single structures or ideal polyalanine helices. These successes suggest that molecular replacement with AMPLE should be the method of choice for the crystallo-graphic elucidation of a coiled-coil structure. Furthermore, AMPLE may be able to exploit the presence of a coiled coil in a complex to provide a convenient route for phasing.},

abstract = {The crystallographic diffraction experiment measures Bragg intensities; crystallographic electron-density maps and other crystallographic calculations in phasing require structure-factor amplitudes. If data were measured with no errors, the structure-factor amplitudes would be trivially proportional to the square roots of the intensities. When the experimental errors are large, and especially when random errors yield negative net intensities, the conversion of intensities and their error estimates into amplitudes and associated error estimates becomes nontrivial. Although this problem has been addressed intermittently in the history of crystallographic phasing, current approaches to accounting for experimental errors in macromolecular crystallography have numerous significant defects. These have been addressed with the formulation of LLGI, a log-likelihood-gain function in terms of the Bragg intensities and their associated experimental error estimates. LLGI has the correct asymptotic behaviour for data with large experimental error, appropriately downweighting these reflections without introducing bias. LLGI abrogates the need for the conversion of intensity data to amplitudes, which is usually performed with the French and Wilson method [French {\&} Wilson (1978), Acta Cryst. A35, 517-525], wherever likelihood target functions are required. It has general applicability for a wide variety of algorithms in macromolecular crystallography, including scaling, characterizing anisotropy and translational noncrystallographic symmetry, detecting outliers, experimental phasing, molecular replacement and refinement. Because it is impossible to reliably recover the original intensity data from amplitudes, it is suggested that crystallographers should always deposit the intensity data in the Protein Data Bank.},

abstract = {Proteins have evolved to perform diverse cellular functions, from serving as reaction catalysts to coordinating cellular propagation and development. Frequently, proteins do not exert their full potential as monomers but rather undergo concerted interactions as either homo-oligomers or with other proteins as hetero-oligomers. The experimental study of such protein complexes and interactions has been arduous. Theoretical structure prediction methods are an attractive alternative. Here, we investigate homo-oligomeric interfaces by tracing residue coevolution via the global statistical direct coupling analysis (DCA). DCA can accurately infer spatial adjacencies between residues. These adjacencies can be included as constraints in structure prediction techniques to predict high-resolution models. By taking advantage of the ongoing exponential growth of sequence databases, we go significantly beyond anecdotal cases of a few protein families and apply DCA to a systematic large-scale study of nearly 2,000 Pfam protein families with sufficient sequence information and structurally resolved homo-oligomeric interfaces. We find that large interfaces are commonly identified by DCA. We further demonstrate that DCA can differentiate between subfamilies with different binding modes within one large Pfam family. Sequence-derived contact information for the subfamilies proves sufficient to assemble accurate structural models of the diverse protein-oligomers. Thus, we provide an approach to investigate oligomerization for arbitrary protein families leading to structural models complementary to often-difficult experimental methods. Combined with ever more abundant sequential data, we anticipate that this study will be instrumental to allow the structural description of many heteroprotein complexes in the future.},

abstract = {The prospect of phasing diffraction data sets ;de novo' for proteins with previously unseen folds is appealing but largely untested. In a first systematic exploration of phasing with Rosetta de novo models, it is shown that all-atom refinement of coarse-grained models significantly improves both the model quality and performance in molecular replacement with the Phaser software. 15 new cases of diffraction data sets that are unambiguously phased with de novo models are presented. These diffraction data sets represent nine space groups and span a large range of solvent contents (33-79{\%}) and asymmetric unit copy numbers (1-4). No correlation is observed between the ease of phasing and the solvent content or asymmetric unit copy number. Instead, a weak correlation is found with the length of the modeled protein: larger proteins required somewhat less accurate models to give successful molecular replacement. Overall, the results of this survey suggest that de novo models can phase diffraction data for approximately one sixth of proteins with sizes of 100 residues or less. However, for many of these cases, ;de novo phasing with de novo models' requires significant investment of computational power, much greater than 10(3) CPU days per target. Improvements in conformational search methods will be necessary if molecular replacement with de novo models is to become a practical tool for targets without homology to previously solved protein structures.},

This information can be efficiently mined to detect evolutionary couplings between residues in proteins and address the long-standing challenge to compute protein three-dimensional structures from amino acid sequences. Substantial progress has recently been made on this problem owing to the explosive growth in available sequences and the application of global statistical methods. In addition to three-dimensional structure, the improved understanding of covariation may help identify functional residues involved in ligand binding, protein-complex formation and conformational changes. We expect computation of covariation patterns to complement experimental structural biology in elucidating the full spectrum of protein structures, their functional interactions and evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Motivation: Accurate contact predictions can be used for predicting the structure of proteins. Until recently these methods were limited to very big protein families, decreasing their utility. However, recent progress by combining direct coupling analysis with machine learning methods has made it possible to predict accurate contact maps for smaller families. To what extent these predictions can be used to produce accurate models of the families is not known. Results: We present the PconsFold2 pipeline that uses contact predictions from PconsC3, the CONFOLD folding algorithm and model quality estimations to predict the structure of a protein. We show that the model quality estimation significantly increases the number of models that reliably can be identified. Finally, we apply PconsFold2 to 6379 Pfam families of unknown structure and find that PconsFold2 can, with an estimated 90{\%} specificity, predict the structure of up to 558 Pfam families of unknown structure. Out of these, 415 have not been reported before. Availability and Implementation: Datasets as well as models of all the 558 Pfam families are avail- able at http://c3.pcons.net/.

abstract = {We have investigated some of the basic principles that influence generation of protein structures using a fragment-based, random insertion method. We tested buildup methods and fragment library quality for accuracy in constructing a set of known structures. The parameters most influential in the construction procedure are bond and torsion angles with minor inaccuracies in bond angles alone causing {\textgreater}6 A CalphaRMSD for a 150-residue protein. Idealization to a standard set of values corrects this problem, but changes the torsion angles and does not work for every structure. Alternatively, we found using Cartesian coordinates instead of torsion angles did not reduce performance and can potentially increase speed and accuracy. Under conditions simulating ab initio structure prediction, fragment library quality can be suboptimal and still produce near-native structures. Using various clustering criteria, we created a number of libraries and used them to predict a set of native structures based on nonnative fragments. Local CalphaRMSD fit of fragments, library size, and takeoff/landing angle criteria weakly influence the accuracy of the models. Based on a fragment's minimal perturbation upon insertion into a known structure, a seminative fragment library was created that produced more accurate structures with fragments that were less similar to native fragments than the other sets. These results suggest that fragments need only contain native-like subsections, which when correctly overlapped, can recreate a native-like model. For fragment-based, random insertion methods used in protein structure prediction and design, our findings help to define the parameters this method needs to generate near-native structures.},

abstract = {A novel approach is described for determining backbone structures of proteins that is based on finding fragments in the protein data bank (PDB). For each fragment in the target protein, usually chosen to be 7-10 residues in length, PDB fragments are selected that best fit to experimentally determined one-bond heteronuclear dipolar couplings and that show agreement between chemical shifts predicted for the PDB fragment and experimental values for the target fragment. These fragments are subsequently refined by simulated annealing to improve agreement with the experimental data. If the lowest-energy refined fragments form a unique structural cluster, this structure is accepted and side chains are added on the basis of a conformational database potential. The sequential backbone assembly process extends the chain by translating an accepted fragment onto it. For several small proteins, with extensive sets of dipolar couplings measured in two alignment media, a unique final structure is obtained that agrees well with structures previously solved by conventional methods. With less dipolar input data, large, oriented fragments of each protein are obtained, but their relative positioning requires either a small set of translationally restraining nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) or a protocol that optimizes burial of hydrophobic groups and pairing of $\beta$-strands.

They are conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and regulate cellular processes as diverse as intercellular signalling, parasitic invasion of host cells, and mitochondrial morphology. Their widespread biological significance and consequent medical potential provides a strong incentive to understand the mechanism of these unusual enzymes for identification of specific inhibitors. In this study, we describe the structure of Escherichia coli rhomboid GlpG covalently bound to a mechanism-based isocoumarin inhibitor. We identify the position of the oxyanion hole, and the S₁- and S₂'-binding subsites of GlpG, which are the key determinants of substrate specificity. The inhibitor-bound structure suggests that subtle structural change is sufficient for catalysis, as opposed to large changes proposed from previous structures of unliganded GlpG. Using bound inhibitor as a template, we present a model for substrate binding at the active site and biochemically test its validity. This study provides a foundation for a structural explanation of rhomboid specificity and mechanism, and for inhibitor design.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the results for the MetaPSICOV2 contact prediction server in the CASP12 community experiment (http://predictioncenter.org). Over the 35 assessed Free Model-ling target domains the MetaPSICOV2 server achieved a mean precision of 43.27{\%}, a substantial increase relative to the server's performance in the CASP11 experiment. In the following paper, we discuss improvements to the MetaPSICOV2 server, covering both changes to the neural net-work and attempts to integrate contact predictions on a domain basis into the prediction pipeline. Sequence covariation analysis has emerged as a powerful technique for accurately predicting contacts in protein 3D structures (Marks et al. 2011, Jones et al. 2012, 2015; Kaj an et al. 2014, Ma et al. 2014, See-mayer et al. 2014, Buchan and Jones 2017). These methods have now been shown to substantially outperform previous non-covariation methods based on neural networks or Support Vector Machines (Tay-lor et al. 2014). Methods integrating covariation analysis demonstrated significant improvements in the contact prediction category in CASP11, where the best performing group (CONSIP2/MetaPSICOV) had a mean precision of 27{\%} (over the top L/5 long-range contacts) (Kinch et al. 2016). This was a marked improvement from the prior CASP10 where the best precision remained around 20{\%} (Taylor et al. 2014). For CASP12, we have continued to improve the CONSIP2 server we developed for CASP11 (Kosciolek and Jones 2016). Our new method, MetaPSICOV2 (entered in to CASP12 under the name 'Meta-PSICOV' with group number 13), is based on the previously published MetaPSICOV method to derive covariation-based contacts (Jones et al. 2015). At its core MetaPSICOV is a meta-predictor based on different covariation prediction algorithms, including mfDCA (Kaj an et al. 2014), CCMpred (Seemayer et al. 2014) and PSICOV (Jones et al. 2012). When there isn't sufficient sequence data available to allow effective covariation analysis, the neural network is able to exploit information from additional machine learning-based methods to enable effective contact prediction across a range of scenarios. In this article, we describe the performance of the MetaPSICOV2 server in the CASP12 experiment, highlighting examples which worked well and discussing areas where there could be further improvements. In the Materials and Methods section, we cover the improvements we've made, which follow on from our analysis of our prior perform-ance in CASP11. The MetaPSICOV2 method follows the same broad prediction protocol as our prior CONSIP2 method. We outline this below and we refer interested readers to the earlier CONSIP2 article for more complete details (Kosciolek and Jones 2016). We also summarise below the sig-nificant differences made to the MetaPSICOV2 server entered in CASP12.},

abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing.In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues, including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7-4.8 {\AA} C($\alpha$)-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

abstract = {Molecular replacement (MR) is the predominant route to solution of the phase problem in macromolecular crystallography. Although routine in many cases, it becomes more effortful and often impossible when the available experimental structures typically used as search models are only distantly homologous to the target. Nevertheless, with current powerful MR software, relatively small core structures shared between the target and known structure, of 20–40{\%} of the overall structure for example, can succeed as search models where they can be isolated. Manual sculpting of such small structural cores is rarely attempted and is dependent on the crystallographer's expertise and understanding of the protein family in question. Automated search-model editing has previously been performed on the basis of sequence alignment, in order to eliminate, for example, side chains or loops that are not present in the target, or on the basis of structural features ( e.g. solvent accessibility) or crystallographic parameters ( e.g. B factors). Here, based on recent work demonstrating a correlation between evolutionary conservation and protein rigidity/packing, novel automated ways to derive edited search models from a given distant homologue over a range of sizes are presented. A variety of structure-based metrics, many readily obtained from online webservers, can be fed to the MR pipeline AMPLE to produce search models that succeed with a set of test cases where expertly manually edited comparators, further processed in diverse ways with MrBUMP , fail. Further significant performance gains result when the structure-based distance geometry method CONCOORD is used to generate ensembles from the distant homologue. To our knowledge, this is the first such approach whereby a single structure is meaningfully transformed into an ensemble for the purposes of MR. Additional cases further demonstrate the advantages of the approach. CONCOORD is freely available and computationally inexpensive, so these novel methods offer readily available new routes to solve difficult MR cases.},

abstract = {Increasing sophistication in molecular-replacement (MR) software and the rapid expansion of the PDB in recent years have allowed the technique to become the dominant method for determining the phases of a target structure in macromolecular X-ray crystallography. In addition, improvements in bioinformatic techniques for finding suitable homologous structures for use as MR search models, combined with developments in refinement and model-building techniques, have pushed the applicability of MR to lower sequence identities and made weak MR solutions more amenable to refinement and improvement. MrBUMP is a CCP 4 pipeline which automates all stages of the MR procedure. Its scope covers everything from the sourcing and preparation of suitable search models right through to rebuilding of the positioned search model. Recent improvements to the pipeline include the adoption of more sensitive bioinformatic tools for sourcing search models, enhanced model-preparation techniques including better ensembling of homologues, and the use of phase improvement and model building on the resulting solution. The pipeline has also been deployed as an online service through CCP 4 online , which allows its users to exploit large bioinformatic databases and coarse-grained parallelism to speed up the determination of a possible solution. Finally, the molecular-graphics application CCP 4 mg has been combined with MrBUMP to provide an interactive visual aid to the user during the process of selecting and manipulating search models for use in MR. Here, these developments in MrBUMP are described with a case study to explore how some of the enhancements to the pipeline and to CCP 4 mg can help to solve a difficult case.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the c-ring from the proton-coupled F1Fo ATP synthase from Spirulina platensis is shown at 2.1-A resolution. The ring includes 15 membrane-embedded c subunits forming an hourglass-shaped assembly. The structure demonstrates that proton translocation across the membrane entails protonation of a conserved glutamate located near the membrane center in the c subunit outer helix. The proton is locked in this site by a precise hydrogen bond network reminiscent of that in Na+-dependent ATP synthases. However, the structure suggests that the different coordination chemistry of the bound proton and the smaller curvature of the outer helix drastically enhance the selectivity of the H+ site against other cations, including H3O+. We propose a model for proton translocation whereby the c subunits remain in this proton-locked state when facing the membrane lipid. Proton exchange would occur in a more hydrophilic and electrostatically distinct environment upon contact with the a subunit interface.},

abstract = {The structure of phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase (TrpF) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrpF) has been determined at 1.75 {\AA} resolution. The PfTrpF structure has a monomeric TIM-barrel fold which differs from the dimeric structures of two other known thermophilic TrpF proteins. A comparison of the PfTrpF structure with the two known bacterial thermophilic TrpF structures and the structure of a related mesophilic protein from Escherichia coli (EcTrpF) is presented. The thermophilic TrpF structures contain a higher proportion of ion pairs and charged residues compared with the mesophilic EcTrpF. These residues contribute to the closure of the central barrel and the stabilization of the barrel and the surrounding $\alpha$-helices. In the monomeric PfTrpF conserved structural water molecules are mostly absent; instead, the structural waters are replaced by direct side-chain-main-chain interactions. As a consequence of these combined mechanisms, the P. furiosus enzyme is a thermodynamically stable and entropically optimized monomeric TIM-barrel enzyme which defines a good framework for further protein engineering for industrial applications.},

The structures show that the side chain of Arg144 stacks against the aromatic moiety of the inhibitor, an interaction made possible by a reorientation of the side chain relative to that seen in the LacNAc complex. Based on these structures, synthesis of second generation LacNAc derivatives carrying aromatic amides at 3'-C, followed by screening with a novel fluorescence polarization assay, has led to the identification of inhibitors with further enhanced affinity for galectin-3 (K(d) {\textgreater} or = 320 nM). The thermodynamic parameters describing the binding of the galectin-3 C-terminal to selected inhibitors were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and showed that the affinity enhancements were due to favorable enthalpic contributions. These enhancements could be rationalized by the combined effects of the inhibitor aromatic structure on a cation-Pi interaction and of direct interactions between the aromatic substituents and the protein. The results demonstrate that protein-ligand interactions can be significantly enhanced by the fine-tuning of arginine-arene interactions.},

abstract = {The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is a protein targeting system found in bacteria, archaea, and chloroplasts. Proteins are directed to the Tat translocase by N-terminal signal peptides containing SRRxFLK “twin-arginine” amino acid motifs. The key feature of the Tat system is its ability to transport fully folded proteins across ionically sealed membranes. For this reason the Tat pathway has evolved for the assembly of extracytoplasmic redox enzymes that must bind cofactors, and so fold, prior to export. It is important that only cofactor-loaded, folded precursors are presented for export, and cellular processes have been unearthed that regulate signal peptide activity. One mechanism, termed “Tat proofreading”, involves specific signal peptide binding proteins or chaperones. The archetypal Tat proofreading chaperones belong to the TorD family, which are dedicated to the assembly of molybdenum-dependent redox enzymes in bacteria. Here, a gene cluster was identified in the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus that is predicted to encode a putative molybdenum-dependent tetrathionate reductase. The gene cluster also encodes a TorD family chaperone (AF0160 or TtrD) and in this work TtrD is shown to bind specifically to the Tat signal peptide of the TtrA subunit of the tetrathionate reductase. In addition, the 3D crystal structure of TtrD is presented at 1.35 {\AA} resolution and a nine-residue binding epitope for TtrD is identified within the TtrA signal peptide close to the twin-arginine targeting motif. This work suggests that archaea may employ a chaperone-dependent Tat proofreading system that is similar to that utilized by bacteria.},

We trapped an early intermediate of the photocycle of sensory rhodopsin II from Natronobacterium pharaonis (pSRII) in 3D crystals and determined its X-ray structure to 2.3 {\AA} resolution. The observed structural rearrangements were localized near the retinal chromophore, with a key water molecule becoming disordered and the retinal's $\beta$-ionone ring undergoing a prominent movement. Comparison with the early structural rearrangements of bacteriorhodopsin illustrates how modifications in the retinal binding pocket of pSRII allow subtle differences in the early relaxation of photoisomerized retinal.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein structure similarity is often measured by root mean squared deviation, global distance test score and template modeling score (TM-score). However, the scores themselves cannot provide information on how significant the structural similarity is. Also, it lacks a quantitative relation between the scores and conventional fold classifications. This article aims to answer two questions: (i) what is the statistical significance of TM-score? (ii) What is the probability of two proteins having the same fold given a specific TM-score?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We first made an all-to-all gapless structural match on 6684 non-homologous single-domain proteins in the PDB and found that the TM-scores follow an extreme value distribution. The data allow us to assign each TM-score a P-value that measures the chance of two randomly selected proteins obtaining an equal or higher TM-score. With a TM-score at 0.5, for instance, its P-value is 5.5 x 10(-7), which means we need to consider at least 1.8 million random protein pairs to acquire a TM-score of no less than 0.5. Second, we examine the posterior probability of the same fold proteins from three datasets SCOP, CATH and the consensus of SCOP and CATH. It is found that the posterior probability from different datasets has a similar rapid phase transition around TM-score=0.5. This finding indicates that TM-score can be used as an approximate but quantitative criterion for protein topology classification, i.e. protein pairs with a TM-score {\textgreater}0.5 are mostly in the same fold while those with a TM-score {\textless}0.5 are mainly not in the same fold.},

abstract = {Background: Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase catalyzes the first committed step of fatty acid biosynthesis. Universally, this reaction involves three functional components all related to a carboxybiotinyl intermediate. A biotinyl domain shuttles its covalently attached biotin prosthetic group between the active sites of a biotin carboxylase and a carboxyl transferase. In Escherichia coli, the three components reside in separate subunits; a biotinyl domain is the functional portion of one of these, biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Results We have expressed natural and selenomethionyl (Se-met) BCCP from E. coli as biotinylated recombinant proteins, proteolyzed them with subtilisin Carlsberg to produce the biotinyl domains BCCPsc and Se-met BCCPsc, determined the crystal structure of Se-met BCCPsc using a modified version of the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing protocol, and refined the structure for the natural BCCPsc at 1.8 {\aa} resolution. The structure may be described as a capped $\beta$ sandwich with quasi-dyad symmetry. Each half contains a characteristic hammerhead motif. The biotinylated lysine is located at a hairpin $\beta$ turn which connects the two symmetric halves of the molecule, and its biotinyl group interacts with a non-symmetric protrusion from the core. Conclusion This first crystal structure of a biotinyl domain helps to unravel the central role of such domains in reactions catalyzed by biotin-dependent carboxylases. The hammerhead structure observed twice in BCCPscmay be regarded as the basic structural motif of biotinyl and lipoyl domains of a superfamily of enzymes. The new MAD phasing techniques developed in the course of determining this structure enhance the power of the MAD method. {\textcopyright} 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

Double-blind assessments of protein structure prediction methods have indicated that the Rosetta algorithm is perhaps the most successful current method for de novo protein structure prediction. In the Rosetta method, short fragments of known proteins are assembled by a Monte Carlo strategy to yield native-like protein conformations. Using only sequence information, successful Rosetta predictions yield models with typical accuracies of 3–6 A˚ C$\alpha$ root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the experimentally determined structures for contiguous segments of 60 or more residues. For each structure prediction, many short simulations starting from different random seeds are carried out to generate an ensemble of decoy structures that have both favorable local interactions and protein-like global properties. This set is then clustered by structural similarity to identify the broadest free energy minima. The effectiveness of conformation modification operators for energy function optimization is also described in this chapter.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional relationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein 3D structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains challenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most existing methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring correlation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole-contact map. A couple of recent methods predict contact map by using mutual information, taking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity restraint, but these methods demand for a very large number of sequence homologs for the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still physically infeasible.$\backslash$nResults: This article presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact map prediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine learning and integer linear programming. The evolutionary restraints are much more informative than mutual information, and the physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among contacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the solution space of the contact map matrix and, thus, significantly improves prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms currently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under consideration.$\backslash$nAvailability: http://raptorx.uchicago.edu.$\backslash$nContact: jinboxu@gmail.com},

Improving the understanding of complex formation has many practical applications, including the rational design of new therapeutic agents and the mechanisms governing signal transduction networks. The generally large, flat, and relatively featureless binding sites of protein complexes pose many challenges for drug design. Fragment docking and direct coupling analysis are used in an integrated computational method to estimate druggable protein-protein interfaces. (i) This method explores the binding of fragment-sized molecular probes on the protein surface using a molecular docking-based screen. (ii) The energetically favorable binding sites of the probes, called hot spots, are spatially clustered to map out candidate binding sites on the protein surface. (iii) A coevolution-based interface interaction score is used to discriminate between different candidate binding sites, yielding potential interfacial targets for therapeutic drug design. This approach is validated for important, well-studied disease-related proteins with known pharmaceutical targets, and also identifies targets that have yet to be studied. Moreover, therapeutic agents are proposed by chemically connecting the fragments that are strongly bound to the hot spots.},

abstract = {Motivation: Accurate recognition of protein fold types is a key step for template-based prediction of protein structures. The existing approaches to fold recognition mainly exploit the features derived from alignments of query protein against templates. These approaches have been shown to be successful for fold recognition at family level, but usually failed at superfamily/fold levels. To overcome this limitation, one of the key points is to explore more structurally informative features of proteins. Although residue-residue contacts carry abundant structural information, how to thoroughly exploit these information for fold recognition still remains a challenge. Results: In this study, we present an approach (called DeepFR) to improve fold recognition at superfamily/fold levels. The basic idea of our approach is to extract fold-specific features from predicted residue-residue contacts of proteins using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) technique. Based on these fold-specific features, we calculated similarity between query protein and templates, and then assigned query protein with fold type of the most similar template. DCNN has showed excellent performance in image feature extraction and image recognition; the rational underlying the application of DCNN for fold recognition is that contact likelihood maps are essentially analogy to images, as they both display compositional hierarchy. Experimental results on the LINDAHL dataset suggest that even using the extracted fold-specific features alone, our approach achieved success rate comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches. When further combining these features with traditional alignment-related features, the success rate of our approach increased to 92.3{\%}, 82.5{\%} and 78.8{\%} at family, superfamily and fold levels, respectively, which is about 18{\%} higher than the state-of-the-art approach at fold level, 6{\%} higher at superfamily level and 1{\%} higher at family level. An independent assessment on SCOP{\_}TEST dataset showed consistent performance improvement, indicating robustness of our approach. Furthermore, bi-clustering results of the extracted features are compatible with fold hierarchy of proteins, implying that these features are fold-specific. Together, these results suggest that the features extracted from predicted contacts are orthogonal to alignment-related features, and the combination of them could greatly facilitate fold recognition at superfamily/fold levels and template-based prediction of protein structures.},

We benchmark the approach with blinded de novo computation of known transmembrane protein structures from 23 families, demonstrating unprecedented accuracy of the method for large transmembrane proteins. We show how the method can predict oligomerization, functional sites, and conformational changes in transmembrane proteins.

The SHELX programs provide a robust and efficient route for routine structure solution by the SAD, MAD and related methods, but involve a number of simplifying assumptions that may limit their applicability in borderline cases. The substructure atoms ( i.e. those with significant anomalous scattering) are first located by direct methods, and the experimental data are then used to estimate phase shifts that are added to the substructure phases to obtain starting phases for the native reflections. These are then improved by density modification and, if the resolution of the data and the type of structure permit, polyalanine tracing. A number of extensions to the tracing algorithm are discussed; these are designed to improve its performance at low resolution. Given native data to 2.5 {\AA} resolution or better, a correlation coefficient greater than 25{\%} between the structure factors calculated from such a trace and the native data is usually a good indication that the structure has been solved.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Speed, accuracy and robustness of building protein fragment library have important implications in de novo protein structure prediction since fragment-based methods are one of the most successful approaches in template-free modeling (FM). Majority of the existing fragment detection methods rely on database-driven search strategies to identify candidate fragments, which are inherently time-consuming and often hinder the possibility to locate longer fragments due to the limited sizes of databases. Also, it is difficult to alleviate the effect of noisy sequence-based predicted features such as secondary structures on the quality of fragment. RESULTS Here, we present FRAGSION, a database-free method to efficiently generate protein fragment library by sampling from an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model. FRAGSION offers some unique features compared to existing approaches in that it (i) is lightning-fast, consuming only few seconds of CPU time to generate fragment library for a protein of typical length (300 residues); (ii) can generate dynamic-size fragments of any length (even for the whole protein sequence) and (iii) offers ways to handle noise in predicted secondary structure during fragment sampling. On a FM dataset from the most recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction, we demonstrate that FGRAGSION provides advantages over the state-of-the-art fragment picking protocol of ROSETTA suite by speeding up computation by several orders of magnitude while achieving comparable performance in fragment quality.

Biochemical, biophysical, and cellular experiments now show that the Mint1 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that binds to APP is intramolecularly inhibited by the adjacent C-terminal linker region. The crystal structure of a C-terminally extended Mint1 PTB fragment reveals that the linker region forms a short alpha-helix that folds back onto the PTB domain and sterically hinders APP binding. This intramolecular interaction is disrupted by mutation of Tyr633 within the Mint1 autoinhibitory helix leading to enhanced APP binding and beta-amyloid production. Our findings suggest that an autoinhibitory mechanism in Mint1 is important for regulating APP processing and may provide novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {As proteins evolve, amino acid positions key to protein structure or function are subject to mutational constraints. These positions can be detected by analyzing sequence families for amino acid conservation or for co-evolution between pairs of positions. Co-evolutionary scores are usually rank-ordered and thresholded to reveal the top pairwise scores, but they also can be treated as weighted networks. Here, we used network analyses to bypass a major complication of co-evolution studies: For a given sequence alignment, alternative algorithms usually identify different, top pairwise scores. We reconciled results from five commonly-used, mathematically divergent algorithms (ELSC, McBASC, OMES, SCA, and ZNMI), using the LacI/GalR and 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase protein families as models. Calculations used unthresholded co-evolution scores from which column-specific properties such as sequence entropy and random noise were subtracted; "central" positions were identified by calculating various network centrality scores. When compared among algorithms, network centrality methods, particularly eigenvector centrality, showed markedly better agreement than comparisons of the top pairwise scores. Positions with large centrality scores occurred at key structural locations and/or were functionally sensitive to mutations. Further, the top central positions often differed from those with top pairwise co-evolution scores: Instead of a few strong scores, central positions often had multiple, moderate scores. We conclude that eigenvector centrality calculations reveal a robust evolutionary pattern of constraints - detectable by divergent algorithms - that occur at key protein locations. Finally, we discuss the fact that multiple patterns co-exist in evolutionary data that, together, give rise to emergent protein functions. This article is protected by copyright.

Here we describe de novo blindstructure predictions of unprecedented accuracy for two proteins in large families made in the recent CASP11 blind test of protein structure prediction methods by incorporating residue-residue co-evolution information in the Rosetta structure prediction program. We then use the method to generate structure models for 58 of the 121 large protein families in prokaryotes for which three dimensionalstructures are not available. These models, which are posted online for public access, provide structural information for the over 400,000 proteins belonging to the 58 families and suggest hypotheses about mechanism for the subset for which the function is known, and hypotheses about function for the remainder.},

abstract = {Predicting accurate fragments from sequence has recently become a critical step for protein structure modeling, as protein fragment assembly techniques are presently among the most efficient approaches for de novo prediction. A key step in these approaches is, given the sequence of a protein to model, the identification of relevant fragments - candidate fragments - from a collection of the available 3D structures. These fragments can then be assembled to produce a model of the complete structure of the protein of interest. The search for candidate fragments is classically achieved by considering local sequence similarity using profile comparison, or threading approaches. In the present study, we introduce a new profile comparison approach that, instead of using amino acid profiles, is based on the use of predicted structural alphabet profiles, where structural alphabet profiles contain information related to the 3D local shapes associated with the sequences. We show that structural alphabet profile-profile comparison can be used efficiently to retrieve accurate structural fragments, and we introduce a fully new protocol for the detection of candidate fragments. It identifies fragments specific of each position of the sequence and of size varying between 6 and 27 amino-acids. We find it outperforms present state of the art approaches in terms (i) of the accuracy of the fragments identified, (ii) the rate of true positives identified, while having a high coverage score. We illustrate the relevance of the approach on complete target sets of the two previous Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) rounds 9 and 10.

abstract = {Motivation: Significant improvements in the prediction of protein residue-residue contacts are observed in the recent years. These contacts, predicted using a variety of coevolution-based and machine learning methods, are the key contributors to the recent progress in ab initio protein structure prediction, as demonstrated in the recent CASP experiments. Continuing the development of new methods to reliably predict contact maps is essential to further improve ab initio structure prediction. Results: In this paper we discuss DNCON2, an improved protein contact map predictor based on two-level deep convolutional neural networks. It consists of six convolutional neural networks - the first five predict contacts at 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5, and 10 angstrom distance thresholds, and the last one uses these five predictions as additional features to predict final contact maps. On the free-modeling datasets in CASP10, 11, and 12 experiments, DNCON2 achieves mean precisions of 35{\%}, 50{\%}, and 53.4{\%}, respectively, higher than 30.6{\%} by MetaPSICOV on CASP10 dataset, 34{\%} by MetaPSICOV on CASP11 dataset, and 46.3{\%} by Raptor-X on CASP12 dataset, when top L/5 long-range contacts are evaluated. We attribute the improved performance of DNCON2 to the inclusion of short- and medium-range contacts into training, two-level approach to prediction, use of the state-of-the-art optimization and activation functions, and a novel deep learning architecture that allows each filter in a convolutional layer to access all the input features of a protein of arbitrary length. Availability: The web server of DNCON2 is at http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/dncon2/ where training and testing datasets as well as the predictions for CASP10, 11, and 12 free-modeling datasets can also be downloaded.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent breakthroughs in protein residue-residue contact prediction have made reliable de novo prediction of protein structures possible. The key was to apply statistical methods that can distinguish direct couplings between pairs of columns in a multiple sequence alignment from merely correlated pairs, i.e. to separate direct from indirect effects. Two classes of such methods exist, either relying on regularized inversion of the covariance matrix or on pseudo-likelihood maximization (PLM). Although PLM-based methods offer clearly higher precision, available tools are not sufficiently optimized and are written in interpreted languages that introduce additional overheads. This impedes the runtime and large-scale contact prediction for larger protein families, multi-domain proteins and protein-protein interactions. RESULTS: Here we introduce CCMpred, our performance-optimized PLM implementation in C and CUDA C. Using graphics cards in the price range of current six-core processors, CCMpred can predict contacts for typical alignments 35-113 times faster and with the same precision as the most accurate published methods. For users without a CUDA-capable graphics card, CCMpred can also run in a CPU mode that is still 4-14 times faster. Thanks to our speed-ups (http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/speed-up) contacts for typical protein families can be predicted in 15-60 s on a consumer-grade GPU and 1-6 min on a six-core CPU. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CCMpred is free and open-source software under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (or later) available at https://bitbucket.org/soedinglab/ccmpred.},

abstract = {The transcriptional antiterminator protein LicT regulates the expression of Bacillus subtilis operons involved in beta-glucoside metabolism. It consists of an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (co-antiterminator (CAT)) and two phosphorylatable phosphotransferase system regulation domains (PRD1 and PRD2). In the activated state, each PRD forms a dimeric unit with the phosphorylation sites totally buried at the dimer interface. Here we present the 1.95 A resolution structure of the inactive LicT PRDs as well as the molecular solution structure of the full-length protein deduced from small angle x-ray scattering. Comparison of native (inactive) and mutant (constitutively active) PRD crystal structures shows massive tertiary and quaternary rearrangements of the entire regulatory domain. In the inactive state, a wide swing movement of PRD2 results in dimer opening and brings the phosphorylation sites to the protein surface. This movement is accompanied by additional structural rearrangements of both the PRD1-PRD1 ' interface and the CAT-PRD1 linker. Small angle x-ray scattering experiments indicate that the amplitude of the PRD2 swing might even be wider in solution than in the crystals. Our results suggest that PRD2 is highly mobile in the native protein, whereas it is locked upon activation by phosphorylation.},

However, in contrast with previous suggestions, these movements and membrane binding do not trigger irreversible conformational changes in the pore-forming MACPF (membrane attack complex/perforin-like) domain, indicating that subsequent monomer-monomer interactions at the membrane surface are required for perforin pore formation.},

abstract = {We have used x-ray crystallography to determine the structures of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) in four different ligation states (unligated, ferric aquomet, oxygenated, and carbonmonoxygenated) to a resolution of better than 1.2 {\AA}. Data collection and analysis were performed in as much the same way as possible to reduce model bias in differences between structures. The structural differences among the ligation states are much smaller than previously estimated, with differences of {\textless}0.25 {\AA} root-mean-square deviation among all atoms. One structural parameter previously thought to vary among the ligation states, the proximal histidine (His-93) azimuthal angle, is nearly identical in all the ferrous complexes, although the tilt of the proximal histidine is different in the unligated form. There are significant differences, however, in the heme geometry, in the position of the heme in the pocket, and in the distal histidine (His-64) conformations. In the CO complex the majority conformation of ligand is at an angle of 18 ± 3°with respect to the heme plane, with a geometry similar to that seen in encumbered model compounds; this angle is significantly smaller than reported previously by crystallographic studies on monoclinic Mb crystals, but still significantly larger than observed by photoselection. The distal histidine in unligated Mb and in the dioxygenated complex is best described as having two conformations. Two similar conformations are observed in MbCO, in addition to another conformation that has been seen previously in low-pH structures where His-64 is doubly protonated. We suggest that these conformations of the distal histidine correspond to the different conformational substrates of MbCO and MbO2 seen in vibrational spectra. Full-matrix refinement provides uncertainty estimates of important structural parameters. Anisotropic refinement yields information about correlated disorder of atoms; we find that the proximal (F) helix and heme move approximately as rigid bodies, but that the distal (E) helix does not.},

abstract = {ARCIMBOLDO solves the phase problem by combining the location of small model fragments using Phaser with density modification and autotracing using SHELXE . Mainly helical structures constitute favourable cases, which can be solved using polyalanine helical fragments as search models. Nevertheless, the solution of coiled-coil structures is often complicated by their anisotropic diffraction and apparent translational noncrystallographic symmetry. Long, straight helices have internal translational symmetry and their alignment in preferential directions gives rise to systematic overlap of Patterson vectors. This situation has to be differentiated from the translational symmetry relating different monomers. ARCIMBOLDO{\_}LITE has been run on single workstations on a test pool of 150 coiled-coil structures with 15–635 amino acids per asymmetric unit and with diffraction data resolutions of between 0.9 and 3.0 {\AA}. The results have been used to identify and address specific issues when solving this class of structures using ARCIMBOLDO . Features from Phaser v.2.7 onwards are essential to correct anisotropy and produce translation solutions that will pass the packing filters. As the resolution becomes worse than 2.3 {\AA}, the helix direction may be reversed in the placed fragments. Differentiation between true solutions and pseudo-solutions, in which helix fragments were correctly positioned but in a reverse orientation, was found to be problematic at resolutions worse than 2.3 {\AA}. Therefore, after every new fragment-placement round, complete or sparse combinations of helices in alternative directions are generated and evaluated. The final solution is once again probed by helix reversal, refinement and extension. To conclude, density modification and SHELXE autotracing incorporating helical constraints is also exploited to extend the resolution limit in the case of coiled coils and to enhance the identification of correct solutions. This study resulted in a specialized mode within ARCIMBOLDO for the solution of coiled-coil structures, which overrides the resolution limit and can be invoked from the command line (keyword coiled{\_}coil) or ARCIMBOLDO{\_}LITE task interface in CCP 4 i .},

Understanding the emergence of novel protein folds is an important step towards understanding the rules governing the evolution of protein structure and function and for developing tools for protein structure modeling and design. We explored the frequency of occurrences of an exhaustively classified library of supersecondary structural elements (Smotifs), in protein structures, in order to identify features that would define a fold as novel compared to previously known structures. We found that a surprisingly small set of Smotifs is sufficient to describe all known folds. Furthermore, novel folds do not require novel Smotifs, but rather are a new combination of existing ones. Novel folds can be typified by the inclusion of a relatively higher number of rarely occurring Smotifs in their structures and, to a lesser extent, by a novel topological combination of commonly occurring Smotifs. When investigating the structural features of Smotifs, we found that the top 10{\%} of most frequent ones have a higher fraction of internal contacts, while some of the most rare motifs are larger, and contain a longer loop region.},

The principal metal-binding site lies on one side of the calycin domain, thus making YodA the first metal-binding lipocalin known.

abstract = {Models generated by de novo structure prediction can be very useful starting points for molecular replacement for systems where suitable structural homologues cannot be readily identified. Protein-protein complexes and de novo-designed proteins are examples of systems that can be challenging to phase. In this study, the potential of de novo models of protein complexes for use as starting points for molecular replacement is investigated. The approach is demonstrated using homomeric coiled-coil proteins, which are excellent model systems for oligomeric systems. Despite the stereotypical fold of coiled coils, initial phase estimation can be difficult and many structures have to be solved with experimental phasing. A method was developed for automatic structure determination of homomeric coiled coils from X-ray diffraction data. In a benchmark set of 24 coiled coils, ranging from dimers to pentamers with resolutions down to 2.5 {\AA}, 22 systems were automatically solved, 11 of which had previously been solved by experimental phasing. The generated models contained 71-103{\%} of the residues present in the deposited structures, had the correct sequence and had free R values that deviated on average by 0.01 from those of the respective reference structures. The electron-density maps were of sufficient quality that only minor manual editing was necessary to produce final structures. The method, named CCsolve, combines methods for de novo structure prediction, initial phase estimation and automated model building into one pipeline. CCsolve is robust against errors in the initial models and can readily be modified to make use of alternative crystallographic software. The results demonstrate the feasibility of de novo phasing of protein-protein complexes, an approach that could also be employed for other small systems beyond coiled coils.},

Their intention is to provide the user with a broad set of results using many search models and to highlight the best of these for further processing. An overview of both programs is presented along with a description of how best to use them, citing case studies and the results of large-scale testing of the software.},

abstract = {Evolution leads to considerable changes in the sequence of biomolecules, while their overall structure and function remain quite conserved. The wealth of genomic sequences, the 'Biological Big Data', modern sequencing techniques provide allows us to investigate biomolecular evolution with unprecedented detail. Sophisticated statistical models can infer residue pair mutations resulting from spatial proximity. The introduction of predicted spatial adjacencies as constraints in biomolecular structure prediction workflows has transformed the field of protein and RNA structure prediction toward accuracies approaching the experimental resolution limit. Going beyond structure prediction, the same mathematical framework allows mimicking evolutionary fitness landscapes to infer signaling interactions, epistasis, or mutational landscapes.},

abstract = {Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) play major roles in cellular growth and development. Mammalian glycolipid transfer proteins (GLTPs) are potential regulators of cell processes mediated by GSLs and display a unique architecture among lipid binding/transfer proteins. The GLTP fold represents a novel membrane targeting/interaction domain among peripheral proteins. Here we report crystal structures of human GLTP bound to GSLs of diverse acyl chain length, unsaturation, and sugar composition. Structural comparisons show a highly conserved anchoring of galactosyl- and lactosyl-amide headgroups by the GLTP recognition center. By contrast, acyl chain chemical structure and occupancy of the hydrophobic tunnel dictate partitioning between sphingosine-in and newly-observed sphingosine-out ligand-binding modes. The structural insights, combined with computed interaction propensity distributions, suggest a concerted sequence of events mediated by GLTP conformational changes during GSL transfer to and/or from membranes, as well as during GSL presentation and/or transfer to other proteins.},

@inproceedings{Andreani2015,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: It has recently become possible to build reliable de novo models of proteins if a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of at least 1000 homologous sequences can be built. Methods of global statistical network analysis can explain the observed correlations between columns in the MSA by a small set of directly coupled pairs of columns. Strong couplings are indicative of residue-residue contacts, and from the predicted contacts a structure can be computed. Here, we exploit the structural regularity of paired $\beta$-strands that leads to characteristic patterns in the noisy matrices of couplings. The $\beta$-$\beta$ contacts should be detected more reliably than single contacts, reducing the required number of sequences in the MSAs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: bbcontacts predicts $\beta$-$\beta$ contacts by detecting these characteristic patterns in the 2D map of coupling scores using two hidden Markov models (HMMs), one for parallel and one for antiparallel contacts. $\beta$-bulges are modelled as indel states. In contrast to existing methods, bbcontacts uses predicted instead of true secondary structure. On a standard set of 916 test proteins, 34{\%} of which have MSAs with {\textless} 1000 sequences, bbcontacts achieves 50{\%} precision for contacting $\beta$-$\beta$ residue pairs at 50{\%} recall using predicted secondary structure and 64{\%} precision at 64{\%} recall using true secondary structure, while existing tools achieve around 45{\%} precision at 45{\%} recall using true secondary structure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: bbcontacts is open source software (GNU Affero GPL v3) available at https://bitbucket.org/soedinglab/bbcontacts .},
