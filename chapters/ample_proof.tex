\section{Introduction}
The introduction of residue-residue contacts as distance restraints in \textit{ab initio} protein structure prediction has proven to be a highly successful approach to limiting the conformation search space thereby enabling successful fold prediction of larger and more \textbeta-rich protein structures \cite[e.g.,][]{Marks2011-os,Michel2014-eg,Kosciolek2014-bt,Ovchinnikov2015-tn,Ovchinnikov2016-jj,Michel2017-xh,De_Oliveira2017-sg,Ovchinnikov2017-nd,Wang2017-rx}. In AMPLE, these two domains are the major limitation for a more successful approach \cite{Bibby2012-lm}. This typically results in user success being limited to small globular and primarily \textalpha-helical folds, or time- and resource-demanding attempts most likely going to be unsuccessful for larger targets

With the advent of contact information, is has thus become essential to identify the extend to which this invaluable bit of information is going to help AMPLE users in the future.

\section{Materials \& Methods}
\subsection{Target selection}
In this study, targets from the ORIGINAL and TRANSMEMBRANE datasets were used. This resulted in a final set of 21 globular and 17 transmembrain protein targets. For details in how the targets were selected refer to \cref{sec:methods_dataset_original,sec:methods_dataset_transmembrane}, and for details on each target refer to \cref{table:appendix_dataset_transmembrane,table:appendix_dataset_original}.

\subsection{Contact prediction} \label{sec:ample_proof_conpred}
For all globular targets, one contact map was predicted with the fully automated metapredictor PCONSC2 v1.0 \cite{Skwark2014-qp}. In summary, four \gls{msa}s were generated with JACKHMMER v3.1b2 \cite{Johnson2010-uz} against the \texttt{uniref100} v2015-10 database and HHBLITS v2.0.15 \cite{Remmert2011-kt} against the \texttt{uniprot20} v2013-03 database \cite{Bateman2017-pb} at E-value cutoffs of 10\textsuperscript{-40}, 10\textsuperscript{-10}, 10\textsuperscript{-4} and 1. Each \gls{msa} was analysed with PSICOV v2.13b3 \cite{Jones2012-ks} and PLMDCA v2 \cite{Ekeberg2014-kf} to produce 16 individual contact predictions. All 16 predictions and per-target PSIPRED v3 \cite{Jones1999-ed} secondary structure prediction, NETSURFP v1.0 \cite{Petersen2009-wy} solvent accessibility information and HHBLITS v2.0.15 \cite{Remmert2011-kt} sequence profile were provided to the PCONSC2 deep learning algorithm \cite{Skwark2014-qp} to identify protein-like contact patterns. The latter produced a final contact map for each target sequence.

An additional contact map for \textbeta-structure containing targets was predicted using CCMPRED v0.3 \cite{Seemayer2014-zp} and reduced to \textbeta-sheet contact pairs using the CCMPRED-specific filtering protocol BBCONTACTS v1.0 \cite{Andreani2015-qn}. Each \gls{msa} for CCMPRED contact prediction was obtained using HHBLITS v2.0.15 \cite{Remmert2011-kt}. This entailed two sequence search iterations with an E-value cutoff of 10\textsuperscript{-3} against the \texttt{uniprot20} v2013-03 database \cite{Bateman2017-pb} and filtering to 90\% sequence identity using HHFILTER v2.0.15 \cite{Remmert2011-kt} to reduce sequence redundancy in the \gls{msa}. Besides the contact matrix as input, BBCONTACTS requires a secondary structure prediction and an estimate of the \gls{msa} diversity. The secondary structure prediction was taken from the PCONSC2 step whilst the diversity factor was calculated using \cref{eq:methods_alndiversity}.

For each transmembrane protein target, a \gls{msa} was generated using HHBLITS v2.0.16 \cite{Remmert2011-kt} against \texttt{uniprot20} v2016-02 database \cite{Bateman2017-pb}. Contact predictions for each transmembrane target were obtained using the metapredictor METAPSICOV v1.04 \cite{Jones2015-vq}, which in turn used the contact prediction algorithms CCMPRED v0.3.2 \cite{Seemayer2014-zp}, FREECONTACT v1.0.21 \cite{Kajan2014-bx} and PSICOV v2.1b3 \cite{Jones2012-ks}. Additionally, a set of contacts was also generated using the MEMBRAIN server v2015-03-15 \cite{Yang2013-bf}.

\subsection{Contact-to-restraint conversion} \label{sec:bbcontacts_addition}
For all targets, the predicted contact maps were converted to ROSETTA restraints to guide \textit{ab initio} structure prediction. The FADE energy function was used to introduce a restraint in ROSETTA's folding protocol. The implementation described by \textcite{Michel2014-eg} was used, which defined a contact to be formed during folding if the participating C\textbeta\ atoms (C\textalpha\ in case of glycine) were within 9\AA\ of one another. The top-$L$ ($L$ corresponds to the number of residues in the target sequence) contact pairs were converted to ROSETTA restraints, and if satisfied a ``squared-well'' bonus of -15.00 added to the energy function.

Additionally to above, all \textbeta-containing targets were subjected to a further conversion step in a separate condition. The approach of adding BBCONTACTS restraints to a previous prediction is outlined in \cref{sec:methods_bbcontacts_addition}.

\subsection{\textit{Ab initio} structure prediction}
Fragments for all targets were selected using the \texttt{make\_fragments.pl} script shipped with ROSETTA. To ensure no homologous fragments were included in the fragment libraries, the \texttt{-nohoms} flag was set. Each target's secondary structure prediction was provided to the fragment picker using the \texttt{-psipredfile} argument. The fragment libraries, contact restraints and secondary structure prediction were subjected to the ROSETTA \texttt{AbinitioRelax} protocol \cite{Rohl2004-dj} to predict 1,000 decoys per target. ROSETTA options were chosen according to the default protocol in AMPLE v1.0 \cite{Bibby2012-lm}. ROSETTA v2015.05.57576 was used for globular targets and v2015.22.57859 for transmembrane ones for all ROSETTA-related protocols.

\subsection{Molecular Replacement in AMPLE}
All generated decoys were subjected to AMPLE v1.0 \cite{Bibby2012-lm} for ensemble search model generation. 

All transmembrane protein targets were processing using AMPLE's default parameters. \Gls{mr} trials were performed with software versions shipped in CCP4 v6.5.13 \cite{Winn2011-xe}, with the exception of SHELXE v2014/14 \cite{Thorn2013-le} and ARP/wARP v7.5 \cite{Cohen2007-wg}.

All globular protein targets were subjected to AMPLE with two deviations from the default parameters. The \texttt{-use\_scwrl} was set to subject all decoys to side-chain remodelling using SCWRL4 \cite{Krivov2009-ex}. Furthermore, the number of clusters to trial was set increased from one to three via the \texttt{-num\_clusters}parameter. All \gls{mr} trials were performed with the version of software shipped with CCP4 v6.5.15 \cite{Winn2011-xe}.

All \gls{mr} solutions were assessed for success using the criteria described in \cref{sec:methods_mr_success}.

\subsection{Analysis of sequence alignments}
Accurate coevolution-based residue-residue contact prediction highly depends on the availability of many divergent homologous sequences. As such, it is important to validate that the selected targets in this study satisfy such requirement.

The depth of alignments obtained for each target sequence shows sufficient numbers of divergent homologous sequences \cref{fig:ample_proof_alndepthcov}. A threshold of 200 sequences is often considered a minimum to infer precise contact predictions by coevolution methods \cite{Simkovic2017-xs}. In this study, all targets exceed this threshold at least 3-fold up to 33-fold \cref{fig:ample_proof_alndepthcov}.

(a) The red line indicates the threshold of 200 effective sequences, which is often considered a minimum for accurate coevolution-based contact prediction \cite{Simkovic2016-wk}. (b) The coverage is calculated as fraction of residues in each \gls{msa} with coverage of more than $5L$ (gray) and $20L$ (red).}
    \label{fig:ample_proof_alndepthcov}

Equally important is the coverage of a \gls{msa} since the alignment depth might only describe the diversity not how well each residue is covered.
