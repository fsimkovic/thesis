\section{Introduction}
\subsection{General introduction}
This thesis is concerned with the application of residue-residue contact prediction data to \gls{mx}. In particular, the main focus centred on improvements to \gls{ample}, a software pipeline developed specifically for unconventional \gls{mx} \gls{mr} cases. The studies conducted and demonstrated in this thesis were done at the forefront of cross-disciplinary work to combine the latest bioinformatics techniques with molecular modelling and \gls{mx}.
