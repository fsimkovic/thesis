- anisotropy --> more reflections in one direction over another, i.e. horizontal compared to vertical
- tNCS --> phase information of molecules in crystal is combined w/o relationship through crystal symmetry
- PHASER log --> avoid floating point errors
- PHASER LLGain --> delta in log likelihood for model compared to random atoms
- Histogram matching (low res) --- Syre's equation (high res) for atomicity (composition)
- Direct methods - measure the phase from isomorphous or anomalous differences 
- Experimental methods - use mathematical relationships between reflection triplets and quartets to bootstrap a phase set for all reflections from phases for a small or random ``seed'' set of reflections
