This thesis is concerned with the application of predicted residue contacts in \textit{ab initio} protein structure prediction and Molecular Replacement.

% Chapter 3
The initial work in this thesis explored the use of predicted residue contacts to improve \textit{ab initio} protein structure predictions, which were used to generate ensemble search models for Molecular Replacement in AMPLE. The results proved highly encouraging. Five additional targets were tractable where previous AMPLE attempts would have been unable to achieve structure solution. In particular, the improved decoy quality appeared to be the main reason for the extended target tractability.

% Chapter 4
Following on from the initial proof-of-concept study, different contact predictions and ROSETTA energy functions were trialled to identify the optimal strategy to generate decoys for unconventional Molecular Replacement in AMPLE.
