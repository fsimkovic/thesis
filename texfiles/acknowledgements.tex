First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr Daniel Rigden for his exceptional supervision throughout my PhD. His invaluable experience taught me a tremendous amount over the last five years, and I would like to thank him for that. I would also like to thank Dan for his constant support and honest opinion regarding all of my research and other endeavours.

I would also like to thank my secondary supervisor Prof Olga Mayans. Six years ago, Olga introduced me to Bioinformatics research, which has proven to be a great experience to this date. I would also like to thank her for her continued support throughout all my projects.

Besides my supervisors, I would like to thank Dr Jens Thomas for his help throughout my PhD project. Jens helped me find my feet with AMPLE and taught me a great deal about good and bad software practices. His opinion is always greatly valued. I would also like to thank Dr Ronan Keegan at CCP4, whose support and guidance helped me understand the mysterious and complex world of X-ray crystallography a little better. I would also like to thank all other members of the CCP4 and CCP-EM core teams for their help and support with all software related issues.

My thanks also go out to my funding bodies, the BBSRC and CCP4, without whose fincancial support this research could have not bee conducted.

Thanks also go to my examiners, Prof Charlotte Deane and Dr Svetlana Antonyuk, for taking the time to examine this thesis and the associated defense.

Last but not least I would like to thank Joanna Lorek for being the most wonderful and supporting partner over the last five years. I would also like to thank my family for their never-ending love and support.
